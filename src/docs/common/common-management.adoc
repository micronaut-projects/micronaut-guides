Inspired by Spring Boot and https://grails.org/[Grails], the Micronaut management dependency adds support for monitoring
of your application via endpoints: special URIs that return details about the health and state of your application.

To use the management features described in this section, add the dependency on your classpath. For example, in build.gradle


[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
dependencies {
...
..
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[tag=management]
}
