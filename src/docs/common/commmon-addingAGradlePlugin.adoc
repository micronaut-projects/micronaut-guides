Adding a Gradle plugin is fairly straightforward and involves a few steps:

. Adding the dependency to the `buildscript { ... }` block in `build.gradle`. This means that you are adding the dependency to the build and not your deliverable application.
. Ensuring the build script dependency will be resolved via the appropriate Maven repositories
. Applying the plugin
