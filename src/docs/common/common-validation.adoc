Micronaut's validation is built on the standard framework â€“ JSR 380, also known as Bean Validation 2.0.

Hibernate Validator is a reference implementation of the validation API. Starting with Micronaut 1.2, Micronaut
https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#beanValidation[has built-in support for validation of beans] that
are annotated with `javax.validation` annotations.

The necessary dependencies are included by default when creating a new application, so you don't need to add anything else.
