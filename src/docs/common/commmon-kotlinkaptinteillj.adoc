== Kotlin, Kapt and IntelliJ

As of this writing, IntelliJ's built-in compiler does not directly support Kapt and annotation processing. You must instead configure Intellij to run Gradle (or Maven) compilation as a build step before running your tests or application class.

First, edit the run configuration for tests or for the application and select "Run Gradle task" as a build step:

Then add the `classes` task as task to execute for the application or for tests the `testClasses` task:

Now whenever you run tests or the application, Micronaut classes will be generated at compilation time.

Read the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#kotlin[Micronaut Kotlin] section to learn more.

Alternatively, you can delegate IntelliJ build/run actions to Gradle completely:
