The `dataStream` method emits instances of `ByteBuffer`. These instances are garbage  collected after each chunk is emitted. In order to propagate the chunks to the response stream they need to be retained by calling the `retain()` method. The framework will call `release()` on these garbage collected chunks once each one is written to the response.
