To publish an event, use dependency injection to obtain an instance of `ApplicationEventPublisher` where the generic type is the type of event and invoke the `publishEvent` method with your event object. For the performance reasons itâ€™s advised to inject an instance of `ApplicationEventPublisher` with a generic type parameter - `ApplicationEventPublisher<{0}>`.
