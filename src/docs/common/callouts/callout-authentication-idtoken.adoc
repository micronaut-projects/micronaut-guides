Set `micronaut.security.authentication` as `idtoken`. The `idtoken` provided by {0} when the OAuth 2.0 Authorization code flow ends will be saved in a cookie. The id token is a signed JWT. For every request, the Micronaut framework extracts the JWT from the Cookie and validates the JWT signature with the remote Json Web Key Set exposed by {0}. JWKS is exposed by the `jws-uri` entry of {0} `.well-known/openid-configuration`.
