The easiest way to install GraalVM is to use https://sdkman.io/[SDKMan.io].

[source, bash]
.Java 8
----
$ sdk install java 21.2.0.r8-grl
----

[source, bash]
.Java 11
----
$ sdk install java 21.2.0.r11-grl
----

[source, bash]
.Java 16
----
$ sdk install java 21.2.0.r16-grl
----

NOTE: GraalVM 21 will be the last release that supports Java 8 and, even if it's supported now, not all bugs are being
backported from the Java 11/16 versions. Our recommended approach is to use GraalVM JDK11 even if you still use Java 8 for your project.

You need to install the `native-image` component which is not installed by default.

[source, bash]
----
$ gu install native-image
----
