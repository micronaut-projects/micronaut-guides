=== Compartment OCID

Find the https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/iam/compartment/list.html[OCID of the compartment] where we'll be deploying. Run this to list all the compartments in your root compartment:

[source,bash]
----
oci iam compartment list
----

and find the compartment by the name or description in the JSON output. It should look like this:

[source,json]
----
{
  "compartment-id": "ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaaaaaaud4g4e5ovjaw...",
  "defined-tags": {},
  "description": "Micronaut guides",
  "freeform-tags": {},
  "id": "ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaarkh3s2wcxbbm...",
  "inactive-status": null,
  "is-accessible": null,
  "lifecycle-state": "ACTIVE",
  "name": "micronaut-guides",
  "time-created": "2021-05-02T23:54:28.392000+00:00"
}
----

Use the OCID from the `id` property; the `compartment-id` property is the parent compartment.

For convenience, save the compartment OCID as an environment variable. For Linux or Mac, run

[source,bash]
----
export C=ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaarkh3s2wcxbbm...
----

or for Windows, if using `cmd` run

[source,bash]
----
set C=ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaarkh3s2wcxbbm...
----

and if using PowerShell run

[source,bash]
----
$C = "ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaarkh3s2wcxbbm..."
----

NOTE: In the examples below we use Linux/Mac syntax for environment variables, e.g. `-c $C`. If you use Windows `cmd`, change those to `-c %C%` (but no change needed if using PowerShell)
