We will use https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM], an advanced JDK with ahead-of-time Native Image compilation, to generate a native executable of this Micronaut application.

Compiling Micronaut applications ahead of time with GraalVM significantly improves startup time and reduces the memory footprint of JVM-based applications.

NOTE: Only Java and Kotlin projects support using GraalVM's `native-image` tool. Groovy relies heavily on reflection, which is only partially supported by GraalVM.
