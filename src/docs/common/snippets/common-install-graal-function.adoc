We will use https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM], the polyglot embeddable virtual machine, to generate a Native executable of our function.

Compiling native executables ahead-of-time with GraalVM improves startup time and reduces the memory footprint of JVM-based applications and functions.

NOTE: Only Java and Kotlin projects support using GraalVM's `native-image` tool. Groovy relies heavily on reflection, which is only partially supported by GraalVM.
