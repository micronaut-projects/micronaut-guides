== Installing OpenAPI Generator

To use OpenAPI Generator, we need to https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator#1---installation[install OpenAPI Generator CLI].

We will use the jar option. https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator#13---download-jar[Download it] and store it in the directory that you want to use for this project.

Next, open terminal in the same directory. To verify that generator works correctly run the `help` command:
[source,bash]
----
java -jar openapi-generator-cli-XXX.jar help
----

It should provide a description and a list of commands.

[NOTE]
===============================
All the options for installation are given at the https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/installation["CLI Installation" guide on the OpenAPI Generator website].

In particular:

* run `brew install openapi-generator` for Homebrew installation,
