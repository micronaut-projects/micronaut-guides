[NOTE]
====
You might get this error message when running your application: +
"Message: The Application Default Credentials are not available. They are available if running in Google Compute Engine. Otherwise, the environment variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS must be defined pointing to a file defining the credentials. See https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/application-default-credentials for more information."

If you are developing locally you can do:
[,bash]
----
gcloud auth application-default login
----
However, it is strongly recommended that you set up a service account.
Follow the instructions in the link above and https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-gcp/latest/guide/#setup[Micronaut GCP setup instructions] for creating and configuring the service account.
