== Test Resources

When the application is started locally -- either under test or by <<running-the-application,running the application>> -- resolution of the `rabbitmq.uri` property is detected and the Test Resources service will start a local RabbitMQ docker container, and inject the properties required to use this as the message broker.

When running under production, you should replace this property with the location of your production message broker via an environment variable.
