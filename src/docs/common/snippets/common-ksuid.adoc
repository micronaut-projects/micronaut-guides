=== Ksuid

Add the following dependency to generate KSUIDs (K-Sortable Globally Unique IDs).
____
KSUID is for K-Sortable Unique IDentifier. It's a way to generate globally unique IDs similar to RFC 4122 UUIDs, but contain a time component so they can be "roughly" sorted by time of creation. The remainder of the KSUID is randomly generated bytes.
