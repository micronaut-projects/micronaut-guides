=== Test

You can test it easily with a JSON Event:

[source, json]
----
{
  "path": "/",
  "httpMethod": "GET",
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "application/json"
  }
}
----

When working with Amazon API Gateway is easy to use `apigateway-aws-proxy` as an `Event Template` to get started:

image::test-event.png[]

You should see a 200 response:
