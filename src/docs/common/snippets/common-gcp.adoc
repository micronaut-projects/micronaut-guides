Install the https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install[Cloud SDK CLI] for your operating system.

Cloud SDK includes the `gcloud` command-line tool. Run the `init` command in your terminal:

=== Google Cloud Platform Project

Create a new project with a unique name (replace `xxxxxx` with alphanumeric characters of your choice):

[source,bash]
----
gcloud projects create micronaut-guides-xxxxxx
----

NOTE: In GCP, project ids are globally unique, so the id you used above is the one you should use in the rest of this guide.

Change your project:

[source,bash]
----
gcloud config set project micronaut-guides-xxxxxx
----

If you forget the project id, you can list all projects:

[source,bash]
----
gcloud projects list
----
