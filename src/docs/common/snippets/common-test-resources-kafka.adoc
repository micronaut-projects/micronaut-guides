== Test Resources

When the application is started locally -- either under test or by <<running-the-application,running the application>> -- resolution of the property `kafka.bootstrap.servers` is detected and the Test Resources service will start a local Kafka docker container, and inject the properties required to use this as the broker.

When running under production, you should replace this property with the location of your production Kafka instance via an environment variable.
