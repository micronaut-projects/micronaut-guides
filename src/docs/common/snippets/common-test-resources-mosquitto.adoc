== Test Resources

For this guide, we will use Mosquitto via Test Resources.
As described in the https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-test-resources/latest/guide/#modules-mqtt[MQTT section of the Test Resources documentation], configure a mosquitto container:

NOTE: This should be done in both apps for this guide.

[source, yaml]
.src/main/resources/application.yml
----
test-resources:
  containers:
    mosquitto:
      image-name: eclipse-mosquitto
      hostnames:
        - mqtt.host
      exposed-ports:
        - mqtt.port: 1883
      ro-fs-bind:
        - "src/test-resources/mosquitto.conf": /mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf
----

And then define the mosquitto configuration file:

[source]
.src/test-resources/mosquitto.conf
----
persistence false
allow_anonymous true
connection_messages true
log_type all
listener 1883
----

As we have defined that Test Resources are shared in the build, both applications will make use of the same instance of Mosquitto.

When running under production, you should replace this property with the location of your production message broker via an environment variable.

[source,shell]
----
MQTT_CLIENT_SERVER_URI=tcp://production-server:1183
