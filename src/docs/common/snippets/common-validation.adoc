Micronaut validation is built on the standard framework â€“ https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=380[JSR 380], also known as Bean Validation 2.0.

Hibernate Validator is a reference implementation of the validation API. Micronaut https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#beanValidation[has built-in support for validation of beans] that are annotated with `javax.validation` annotations.

The necessary dependencies are included by default when creating a new application, so you don't need to add anything else.
