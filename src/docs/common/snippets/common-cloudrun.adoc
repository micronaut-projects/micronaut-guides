WARNING: A long list of credential helpers may cause delays running 'docker build'. We recommend passing the registry name to configure only the registry you are using.
After update, the following will be written to your Docker config file
 located at [~/.docker/config.json]:
 {
  "credHelpers": {
    "gcr.io": "gcloud",
    "marketplace.gcr.io": "gcloud",
    "eu.gcr.io": "gcloud",
    "us.gcr.io": "gcloud",
    "staging-k8s.gcr.io": "gcloud",
    "asia.gcr.io": "gcloud"
  }
