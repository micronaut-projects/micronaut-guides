=== Enable Distributed Configuration

Create a `bootstrap.yml` file in the `resources` directory to https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#bootstrap[enable distributed configuration].
Add the following:

resource:bootstrap.yml[tag=distributedconfiguration]

<1> Set the application name in `bootstrap.yml` instead of `application.yml` so that it is available when reading configuration from distributed sources.
properties
<2> Set `microanut.config-client.enabled: true` which is used to read and resolve configuration from distributed sources.

=== Clean up Application Configuration

If `application.yml` sets `micronaut.application.name`, remove it. You moved it to `bootstrap.yml`.
