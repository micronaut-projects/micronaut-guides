== Test Resources

When the application is started locally -- either under test or by <<running-the-application,running the application>> -- resolution of the property `mongodb.uri` is detected and the Test Resources service will start a local MongoDB docker container, and inject the properties required to use this as the datasource.

For more information, see the https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-test-resources/snapshot/guide/#modules-mongodb[MongoDB section of the Test Resources documentation].
