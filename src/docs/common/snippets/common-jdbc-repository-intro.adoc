Next, we will create a repository interface and define the required operations to access the database. Micronaut Data will implement the interface at compilation time. It will determine the operations to be implemented based on method naming and parameters, and supports https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-data/latest/guide/#dataUpdates[simple create, read, update, delete operations] along with https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-data/latest/guide/#querying[highly-customizable queries].
