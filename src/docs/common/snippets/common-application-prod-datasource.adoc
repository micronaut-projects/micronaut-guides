== Configuration for production
  
When the application is run in a non-local environment, you will need to specify the datasource URL and credentials in a configuration that matches the specific environment.
This can be achieved by adding a configuration specific to that environment like so:

resource:application-prod.yml[tag=prod-datasource]

And then run the application with the following environment variables:

- `MICRONAUT_ENVIRONMENTS=prod`
- `DATASOURCES_DEFAULT_USERNAME=<username>`
- `DATASOURCES_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=<password>`

NOTE: Instead of environment variables, you can also use https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#distributedConfiguration[Micronaut Distributed Configuration] to pull these values from a secrets manager such as Hashicorp Vault.
