==== JSON Assert

The previous test uses https://github.com/skyscreamer/JSONassert[JSON Assert]:

> Write JSON tests as if you are comparing a string. Under the covers, JSONassert converts your string into a JSON object and compares the logical structure and data with the actual JSON.

You need to add the dependency to your test classpath:

dependency:jsonassert[groupId=org.skyscreamer,version=@jsonassertVersion@,scope=test]
