== GraalVM Resource Configuration

We need the following configuration to https://www.graalvm.org/jdk17/reference-manual/native-image/dynamic-features/Resources/[access resources in Native Image]
____
By default, the native-image builder will not integrate any of the resources that are on the classpath into the native executable.

Create a new file `src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image/example.micronaut.micronautguide/resource-config.json`:

resource:META-INF/native-image/example.micronaut.micronautguide/resource-config.json[]
