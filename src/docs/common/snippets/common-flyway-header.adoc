=== Database Migration with Flyway

We need a way to create the database schema. For that, we use
https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-flyway/latest/guide/[Micronaut integration with Flyway].

http://www.flyway.org[Flyway] automates schema changes, significantly simplifying schema management tasks, such as migrating, rolling back, and reproducing in multiple environments.

Add the following snippet to include the necessary dependencies:

:dependencies:
dependency:micronaut-flyway[groupId=io.micronaut.flyway]
ifeval::["{database}" == "mysql"]
dependency:flyway-mysql[groupId=org.flywaydb,scope=runtimeOnly]
endif::[]
:dependencies:

We will enable Flyway in the `application.yml` and configure it to perform migration on one of the defined data sources.
