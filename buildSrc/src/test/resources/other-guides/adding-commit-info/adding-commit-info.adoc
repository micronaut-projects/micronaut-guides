In this guide, we will add git commit info to your Micronaut build artifacts and running application.
There are many benefits of keeping your commit info handy:

* Commit info is encapsulated within the built artifacts

* Fast authoritative means of identifying what specific code is running in an environment

* This solution doesn't rely on external tracking mechanisms

* Transparency and reproducibility when investigating issues

NOTE: Before running the downloaded project, follow the steps described in the *Initialize Git Repository* section below.

== Initialize Git Repository

The project aims to demonstrate how to provide Git commit information to the
`/info` endpoint and in order for that to work the project needs to be in a Git repository.
After creating the project, initialize a Git repository from the root of the newly created project:

[source,bash]
----
cd micronautguide
git init
git add .
git commit -am "Initial project"
----

== Management

Inspired by Spring Boot and Grails, the Micronaut management dependency adds support for monitoring of your application via endpoints: special URIs that return details about the health and state of your application.

To use the management features described in this section, add the dependency on your classpath.
