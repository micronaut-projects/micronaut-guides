== Monitor metrics on Amazon CloudWatch

To publish metrics to Amazon CloudWatch, you have to adjust your application configuration slightly, and then you will be able to create queries and monitor your metrics on https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch#metricsV2:graph=~()[Cloudwatch].

resource:application.properties[tag=metrics]

<1> Change to `false` to disable all metrics, e.g., per-environment
<2> These default to `true` and are only here for convenience, to be able to disable a subset of metrics
<3> Change the namespace to something meaningful, for example, the app's name. In this guide, we are using `micronautguide`

=== Visit the https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch#metricsV2:graph=~()[Amazon CloudWatch] Metrics.

In the Metrics panel, select the namespace that you chose earlier. We select `micronautguide`.
