== Getting Started

In this guide you are going to setup JWT based authentication and configure it so that
JWT tokens are transported and read via Cookies.

The following sequence illustrates the authentication flow:

include::{commondir}/common-requirements.adoc[]

include::{commondir}/common-completesolution.adoc[]


== Writing the Application

Create an app using the http://docs.micronaut.io/snapshot/guide/index.html#cli[Micronaut Command Line Interface].

`mn create-app example.micronaut.complete --test=spock --lang=@lang@`

The previous command creates a micronaut app with the default package `example.micronaut` in a folder named `complete`.

include::{commondir}/common-annotationprocessors.adoc[]


=== Security Dependency

Add Micronaut's JWT security dependency.

:dependencies:

dependency:micronaut-security-annotations[groupId=io.micronaut.security,scope=annotationProcessor]
dependency:micronaut-security-jwt[groupId=io.micronaut.security]

:dependencies:

=== Configuration

Add the following configuration:

resource:application.yml[tag=security]

<1> Enable Cookie authentication.
<2> If the login fails, redirect to `/login/authFailed`
<3> You can create a http://docs.micronaut.io/snapshot/api/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/signature/secret/SecretSignatureConfiguration.html[SecretSignatureConfiguration] named `generator` via configuration as illustrated above. The `generator` signature is used to sign the issued JWT claims.
<4> Change this by your own secret and keep it safe.


=== Authentication Provider

To keep this guide simple, create a naive `AuthenticationProvider` to simulate user's authentication.

source:AuthenticationProviderUserPassword[]

<1> To register a Singleton in Micronaut's application context annotate your class with `javax.inject.Singleton`
<2> A Micronaut's Authentication Provider implements the interface `io.micronaut.security.authentication.AuthenticationProvider`


=== Apache Velocity

By default, Micronaut's controllers produce JSON. Usually, you consume those endpoints with a mobile phone application,
or a Javascript front end (Angular, React, Vue.js ...). However, to keep this guide simple we are going to produce
HTML in our controllers.

In order to do that, we use http://velocity.apache.org[Apache Velocity].
____
Velocity is a Java-based template engine. It permits anyone to use a simple yet powerful template language to reference objects defined in Java code.
____

Add a dependency to Micronaut's https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#views[Server Side View Rendering Module] and to Velocity:

dependency:micronaut-views-velocity[groupId=io.micronaut.views]

Create two velocity templates in `src/main/resources/views`:

resource:views/home.vm[]

resource:views/auth.vm[]


=== Controllers

Create a file named `HomeController` which resolves the base URL `/`:

source:HomeController[]

<1> Annotate with `io.micronaut.security.Secured` to configure security access. Use `isAnonymous()` expression for anonymous access.
<2> Annotate with `io.micronaut.http.annotation.Controller` to designate a class as a Micronaut's controller.
<3> You can specify the HTTP verb for which a controller's action responds to. To respond to a GET request, use `io.micronaut.http.annotation.Get`
<4> You can specify the HTTP verb for which a controller's action responds to. To respond to a GET request, use `io.micronaut.http.annotation.Get`.
<5> If you are authenticated, you can use the `java.security.Principal` as a parameter type. For parameters which maybe null, use `javax.annotation.Nullable`.


=== Login Form

Next, create `LoginAuthController` which renders the login form.

source:LoginAuthController[]

<1> Annotate with `io.micronaut.security.Secured` to configure security access. Use `isAnonymous()` expression for anonymous access.
<2> Annotate with `io.micronaut.http.annotation.Controller` to designate a class as a Micronaut's controller.
<3> responds to GET requests at `/login/auth`
<4> Use https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/views/View.html[View] annotation to specify which template would you like to render the response against.
<5> responds to GET requests at `/login/authFailed`


== Tests

include::{commondir}/common-geb.adoc[]

Create two pages:

rawTest:HomePage[]

rawTest:LoginPage[]


Create a tests which verifies the user authentication flow.

rawTest:AuthenticationSpec[tag=clazz]

<1> Annotate the class with `@MicronautTest` to let Micronaut starts the embedded server and inject the beans. More info: https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-test/latest/guide/index.html[https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-test/latest/guide/index.html].
<2> Inject the `EmbeddedServer` bean.
