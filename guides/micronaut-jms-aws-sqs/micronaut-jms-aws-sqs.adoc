== Micronaut JMS SQS Dependency

To use the Micronaut JMS SQS integration, add the following dependency:

dependency:micronaut-jms-sqs[groupId=io.micronaut.jms]

== Create an application

=== Creating a JMS Producer
source:DemoProducer[]

=== Creating a JMS Consumer
source:DemoConsumer[]

=== Creating a Controller
source:DemoController[]

=== Configure a SQS client factory
Additionally, youâ€™ll need to configure an instance of `com.amazonaws.services.sqs.AmazonSQS` as a bean for AWS authentication, for example:
source:SqsClientFactory[]

== Creating a queue instance in Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)

You will create a queue with the AWS CLI. See the https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/sqs/index.html[AWS CLI `sqs` command] for more information.

=== Create a queue instance

[source,bash]
----
aws sqs create-queue --queue-name demo_queue
----
Copy and save the response of the command. You will need the `QueueUrl` to delete the queue after you finish with it.

== Update the Application configuration to use AWS

=== Add the AWS IAM user access key and secret key placeholders to the Application Configuration
[,diff]
.src/main/resources/application.yml
----
micronaut:
  application:
    name: demo
  jms:
    sqs:
      enabled: true
+ aws:
+  access-key-id: ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
+  secret-key: ${AWS_SECRET_KEY}
----

== Running the Application

With almost everything in place, you can start the application and try it out. First, set environment variables to configure the queue connection. Then you can start the app.

Create environment variables for `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and `AWS_SECRET_KEY`, which will be used in the Micronaut app's `application.yml`:

[source,bash]
----
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<the access key from the AWS configuratipn step>
export AWS_SECRET_KEY=<the secret key from the AWS configuratipn step>
----

[NOTE]
.Window System
====
Command Prompt:: Change '*export*' to '*set*'
+
Example: `set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=aws_access_key`

PowerShell:: Change '*export* ' to '*$*' and use quotes around the value
+
Example: `$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="aws_access_key"`
====

common:runapp-instructions.adoc[]

You can test the application in a web browser or with cURL.

Run from a terminal window to publish and consume a message:

[source, bash]
----
curl "http://localhost:8080/demo"
----

=== Stopping the Instance and cleaning up

Once you are done with this guide, you can stop/delete the AWS resources created to avoid incurring unnecessary charges.

[source,bash]
----
aws sqs delete-queue --queue-url <QUEUE_URL>
----
Replace the `<QUEUE_URL>` placeholder with a queue URL value returned from the `create-queue` command.
