== Getting Started

In this guide, we will create two microservices and configure them to use multitenancy with tenant propagation.

Let's describe the microservices you will build through the guide.

* `gateway` - A microservice that resolves a Tenant ID with a cookie and propagates the Tenant ID to outgoing requests via HTTP Header.
* `books` - A microservice that uses https://gorm.grails.org[GORM] to provide a data-access layer with multitenacy support.

The next diagram illustrates the flow:

common:completesolution.adoc[]

== Writing the App

We will be using Groovy for this guide in order to demonstrate the use of multitenancy with https://gorm.grails.org[GORM], the powerful Groovy-based data-access toolkit from the Grails framework.

== Gateway

Create the microservice:

[source,bash]
----
mn create-app example.micronaut.gateway --test=spock --lang=groovy
----

In the previous command, we generate a Micronaut application and tell the CLI to use https://spockframework.org[Spock] as the test framework.

=== Multitenancy Configuration

Multitenancy, as it relates to software development, is when a single instance of an application services multiple clients (tenants) in a way that each tenant's data is isolated from the others.

To use Micronaut multitenancy capabilities, you must have the multitenancy dependency:

dependency:micronaut-multitenancy[app=gateway,groupId=io.micronaut.multitenancy]

resource:application.yml[app=gateway,tag=multitenancy]

<1> Enable tenant propagation.
<2> Propagate the resolved Tenant ID only in requests going to a particular set of services.
In our example, we define a regex to match the Service ID `books`.
<3> In the gateway, we use the https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-multitenancy/latest/api/io/micronaut/multitenancy/tenantresolver/CookieTenantResolver.html[CookieTenantResolver], which resolves the current tenant from an HTTP cookie.
<4> We propagate the tenant with a https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-multitenancy/latest/api/io/micronaut/multitenancy/writer/HttpHeaderTenantWriter.html[HttpHeaderTenantWriter], which writes the current tenant to a HTTP header.

=== HTTP Filter & Cookie Redirect

The Micronaut HTTP server supports the ability to apply filters to request/response processing in a similar but reactive way to Servlet filters in traditional Java applications.

Create a filter to redirect to `/tenant` if you attempt to access `/` without a cookie.
That it is to say, in a situation where the application is not able to resolve the Tenant ID.

source:HomePageFilter[app=gateway]

<1> You can match only a subset of paths with a server filter.
<2> Constructor injection.

=== HTTP Client

Create an interface to encapsulate the communication with the `books` microservice, which we will create shortly.

source:Book[app=gateway]
source:BookFetcher[app=gateway]

Create a https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#clientAnnotation[declarative HTTP client]:

source:BookClient[app=gateway]

<1> The `@Client` annotation uses a Service ID, which matches the regular expression we defined in the propagation configuration.
<2> We don't want to load this bean in the `test` environment.
<3> We configure the path `/books` and HTTP method of the endpoint exposed by `books`.

Configure the URLs for the Service ID `books`.
Modify `application.yml`

resource:application.yml[app=gateway,tag=http-services]

<1> Same ID we used with `@Client`
<2> URL where the `books` service will reside.

=== Home Controller

The `views` module provides support for view rendering on the server side; it does so by rendering views on the I/O thread pool in order to avoid blocking the Netty event loop. Add the `views` dependency:

dependency:micronaut-views-handlebars[groupId=io.micronaut.views]

The previous dependency includes https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/api/[HandlebarsViewsRenderer], which uses the https://jknack.github.io/handlebars.java/[Handlebars.java] project.

Create a view, which we will use in the `HomeController`.

resource:views/home.hbs[app=gateway]

Create a `HomeController` that invokes `BookClient::fetchBooks()` and renders the books using the previous handlebar view.

source:HomeController[app=gateway]

<1> Annotate with `io.micronaut.http.annotation.Controller` to designate a class as a Micronaut controller.
<2> Constructor dependency injection.
<3> Use `@View` annotation to indicate the view name that should be used to render a view for the route.
<4> You can specify the HTTP verb that a controller action responds to.
To respond to a GET request, use the `io.micronaut.http.annotation.Get` annotation.
<5> The model is returned containing the values read from the server

=== Tenant Controller

`HomePageFilter` redirects to `/tenant` when the Tenant ID is not resolved. Create `TenantController` to handle that endpoint:

source:TenantController[app=gateway]

callout:controller[number=1,arg0=/tenant]
<2> Constructor injection of `CookieTenantResolverConfiguration`, a configuration object that's used by the `CookieTenantResolver``
<3> Use `@View` annotation to indicate the view name that should be used to render a view for the route.
<4> You can specify the HTTP verb that a controller action responds to. To respond to a GET request, use the `io.micronaut.http.annotation.Get` annotation.
<5> Define a path variable `tenant`.
<6> Do a 302 redirect to `/`, setting a cookie with the selected Tenant ID.

=== Tenant View

The previous controller renders the `tenant` view.

resource:views/tenant.hbs[app=gateway]

=== Tests

Provide a `BookFetcher` bean replacement for the Test environment.

test:MockBookFetcher[app=gateway]

Create a test to verify the flow using https://gebish.org[Geb].

Add dependencies for Geb:

:dependencies:

dependency:geb-spock[groupId=org.gebish,scope=testImplementation,version=@geb-spockVersion@]
dependency:htmlunit-driver[groupId=org.seleniumhq.selenium,scope=testImplementation,version=@htmlunit-driverVersion@]

:dependencies:

Add a https://gebish.org/manual/current/#configuration[Geb configuration script]:

testResource:GebConfig.groovy[app=gateway]

Create two Geb Pages:

test:HomePage[app=gateway]
test:TenantPage[app=gateway]

Write a test to verify that a user visiting the home page without a tenant is redirected to the tenant selection page. After tenant selection, the home page loads a set of books.

test:HomePageSpec[app=gateway]

<1> Start an `EmbeddedServer`.
<2> Point the browser base URL to the embedded server URL.

== Books Microservice

Create the microservice:

[source,bash]
----
mn create-app example.micronaut.books --lang=groovy
----

=== GORM

https://gorm.grails.org[GORM] is a powerful Groovy-based data-access toolkit for the JVM. To use it in a Micronaut application, add the following dependencies:

:dependencies:

dependency:micronaut-multitenancy[]
dependency:micronaut-multitenancy-gorm[groupId=io.micronaut.groovy]

:dependencies:

Configure multiple data sources as described in the https://gorm.grails.org/latest/hibernate/manual/#multipleDataSources[GORM Multiple Data Sources] documentation.

resource:application.yml[app=books,tag=datasources]

=== Domain

GORM supports several https://gorm.grails.org/latest/hibernate/manual/#_multi_tenancy_modes[tenancy modes].
In this guide we use `DATABASE`, where a separate database with a separate connection pool stores each tenant's data.

Add the following configuration to `application.yml`

resource:application.yml[app=books,tag=gorm]

<1> Use `DATABASE` mode.
<2> Use `HttpHeaderTenantResolver`, which resolves the Tenant ID from an HTTP header.
Remember we configured the `gateway` microservice to propagate the Tenant ID in an HTTP header.

Create a GORM Entity to persist books:

source:Book[app=books]

callout:gorm-entity[1]
callout:gorm-entity-ide[2]
<3> Implement the `MultiTenant` trait in the GORM entities you want to be regarded as multitenant.

=== Data Service

https://gorm.grails.org/latest/hibernate/manual/#dataServices[GORM Data Services] take the work out of implemented service-layer logic by adding the ability to automatically implement abstract classes or interfaces using GORM logic.

source:BookService[app=books]

<1> Resolve the current tenant for the context of a class or method
<2> The `@Service` annotation is an AST transformation that will automatically implement the service for you.

=== Controller

Create a controller to expose the `/books` endpoint.

source:BookResponse[app=books]

source:BookController[app=books]

callout:controller[number=1,arg0=/books]
<2> Constructor dependency injection.

=== Bootstrap

To listen to an event, register a bean that implements `ApplicationEventListener`, where the generic type is the type of event the listener should be executed for.

We want to listen for the `StartupEvent` to save some elements in the databases when the application starts:

source:Bootstrap[app=books]

<1> This bean will not be loaded for the test environment.
callout:singleton[2]
<3> Listen to `StartupEvent`.
<4> Field injection
<5> You can specify the Tenant ID with the `Tenants.withId` method.

=== Book Tests

Create a test to verify the behaviour. We received the books belonging to the tenant, which we send via an HTTP header.

test:BookControllerSpec[app=books]

== Running the Application

Run both microservices:

[source,bash]
.books
----
./gradlew run
----

[source]
----
18:29:26.500 [main] INFO  io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut - Startup completed in 671ms. Server Running: http://localhost:8081
<=========----> 75% EXECUTING [10s]
----

[source,bash]
.gateway
----
./gradlew run
----

[source]
----
18:28:35.723 [main] INFO  io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut - Startup completed in 707ms. Server Running: http://localhost:8080
----

You can visit http://localhost:8080 and change the tenant and see the book list change:
