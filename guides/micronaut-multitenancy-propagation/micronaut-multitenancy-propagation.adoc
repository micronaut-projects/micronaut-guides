== Getting Started

In this guide, we are going to create two microservices and configure them to use multitenancy with tenant propagation.

Let's describe the microservices you are going to build through the tutorial.

* `gateway` - A microservice which resolves a Tenant ID with a Cookie and propagates the Tenant ID to outgoing requests via HTTP Header.
* `books` - A microservice which uses http://gorm.grails.org[GORM] to provide data access layer with multitenacy support.

The next diagram illustrates the flow:

== Writing the App

We will be using Groovy for this guide in order to demonstrate the use of multitenancy with http://gorm.grails.org[GORM], the powerful Groovy-based data access toolkit from the Grails framework.

== Gateway

Create the microservice:

[source,bash]
----
mn create-app example.micronaut.gateway --test=spock --lang=groovy
----

In the previous command, we are generating a Micronaut app and telling the CLI to use https://spockframework.org[Spock] as the test framework.

=== Multitenancy Configuration

Multi-Tenancy, as it relates to software development, is when a single instance of an application is used to service multiple clients (tenants) in a way that each tenants' data is isolated from the other.

To use the Micronaut’s multitenancy capabilities you must have the multitenancy dependency on your classpath.
For example in `build.gradle:`

dependency:micronaut-multitenancy[app=gateway]

resource:application.yml[app=gateway,tag=multitenancy]

<1> Enable tenant propagation.
<2> Propagate the resolved tenant ID only in requests going to a particular set of services.
In our example, we define a regex to match the service id `books`.
<3> In the gateway we use the https://docs.micronaut.io/snapshot/api/io/micronaut/multitenancy/tenantresolver/CookieTenantResolver.html[CookieTenantResolver] which resolves the current tenant from an HTTP cookie.
<4> We propagate the tenant with a https://docs.micronaut.io/snapshot/api/io/micronaut/multitenancy/writer/HttpHeaderTenantWriter.html[HttpHeaderTenantWriter] which writes the current tenant to a HTTP Header.

=== Http Filter & Cookie Redirect

The Micronaut HTTP server supports the ability to apply filters to request/response processing in a similar, but reactive, way to Servlet filters in traditional Java applications.

Create a filter to redirect to `/tenant` if you attempt to access `/` without a cookie.
That it is to say, in a situation where the application is not able to resolve the tenant ID.

source:HomePageFilter[app=gateway]

<1> You can match only a subset of paths with a server filter.
<2> Constructor injection.

=== Http Client

Create an interface to encapsulate the communication with the `books` microservice which we will create shortly.

source:Book[app=gateway]
source:BookFetcher[app=gateway]

Create a https://docs.micronaut.io/snapshot/guide/index.html#clientAnnotation[declarative HTTP client]:

source:BookClient[app=gateway]

<1> The `@Client` annotation uses a service id which matches the regular expression we defined in the propagation configuration.
<2> We don't want to load this bean in the `test` environment.
<3> We configure the path `/books` and HTTP method of the endpoint exposed by `books`.

Configure the urls for the service id `books`.
Modify `application.yml`

resource:application.yml[app=gateway,tag=http-services]

<1> Same id we used with `@Client`
<2> url where the `books` service will reside.

=== Home Controller

The `views` module provides support for view rendering on the server side and does so by rendering views on the I/O thread pool in order to avoid blocking the Netty event loop.
Add the `views` dependency to  `build.gradle:`

dependency:micronaut-views-handlebars[groupId=io.micronaut.views]

The previous dependency includes https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/api/index.html[HandlebarsViewsRenderer] which uses the http://jknack.github.io/handlebars.java/[Handlebars.java] project.

Create a view which we will use in the `HomeController`.

resource:views/home.hbs[app=gateway]

Create a `HomeController` which invokes `BookClient::fetchBooks()` and renders the books using the previous handlebar view.

source:HomeController[app=gateway]

<1> Annotate with `io.micronaut.http.annotation.Controller` to designate a class as a Micronaut’s controller.
<2> Constructor dependency injection.
<3> Use `@View` annotation to indicate the view name which should be used to render a view for the route.
<4> You can specify the HTTP verb that a controller’s action responds to.
To respond to a GET request, use the `io.micronaut.http.annotation.Get` annotation.
<5> The model is returned containing the values read from the server

=== Tenant Controller

`HomePageFilter` redirects to `/tenant` when the tenant ID is not resolved. Create `TenantController` to handle that endpoint:

source:TenantController[app=gateway]

<1> The class is defined as a controller with the `@Controller` annotation mapped to the path `/tenant`.
<2> Constructor injection of `CookieTenantResolverConfiguration`. A configuration object which is used by the `CookieTenantResolver``
<3> Use `@View` annotation to indicate the view name which should be used to render a view for the route.
<4> You can specify the HTTP verb that a controller’s action responds to. To respond to a GET request, use the `io.micronaut.http.annotation.Get` annotation.
<5> Define a path variable `tenant`.
<6> Do a 302 redirect to `/` setting a cookie with the selected tenant ID.

=== Tenant View

The previous controller renders the `tenant` view.

resource:views/tenant.hbs[app=gateway]

=== Tests

Provide a `BookFetcher` bean replacement for the Test environment.

test:MockBookFetcher[app=gateway]

Create a tests which verifies the flow using https://gebish.org[Geb].

Add dependencies for Geb:

:dependencies:

dependency:geb-spock:4.1[groupId=org.gebish,scope=testImplementation]
dependency:htmlunit-driver:2.49.1[groupId=org.seleniumhq.selenium,scope=testImplementation]

:dependencies:

Add a https://gebish.org/manual/current/#configuration[Geb configuration script]:

testResource:GebConfig.groovy[app=gateway]

Create two Geb Pages:

test:HomePage[app=gateway]
test:TenantPage[app=gateway]

Write a test which verifies that when the user visits the home page without a tenant is redirected to the tenant selection page.
After tenant selection, the home page loads a set of books.

test:HomePageSpec[app=gateway]

<1> Start an `EmbeddedServer`.
<2> Point the browser base url to the embedded server url.

== Books Microservice

Create the microservice:

[source,bash]
----
mn create-app example.micronaut.books --lang=groovy
----

=== GORM

http://gorm.grails.org[GORM] is a powerful Groovy-based data access toolkit for the JVM.
To use it in Micronaut add the following dependencies to `build.gradle`:

:dependencies:

dependency:micronaut-multitenancy[]
dependency:micronaut-multitenancy-gorm[groupId=io.micronaut.groovy]

:dependencies:

Configure multiple data sources as described in the http://gorm.grails.org/latest/hibernate/manual/index.html#multipleDataSources[GORM Multiple Data Sources] documentation.

resource:application.yml[app=books,tag=datasources]

=== Domain

GORM supports several http://gorm.grails.org/latest/hibernate/manual/index.html#_multi_tenancy_modes[tenancy modes].
In this tutorial we use `DATABASE` where a separate database with a separate connection pool is used to store each tenants data.

Add the following configuration to `application.yml`

resource:application.yml[app=books,tag=gorm]

<1> Use `DATABASE` mode.
<2> Use `HttpHeaderTenantResolver` which resolves the tenant ID from an HTTP header.
Remember we configured the `gateway` microservice to propagate the tenant ID in an HTTP Header.

Create a GORM Entity to persist books:

source:Book[app=books]

<1> GORM entities are annotated with `grails.persistence.Entity`.
<2> Use of `GormEntity` is merely to aid IDE support outside of Grails.
When used inside a Grails context, some IDEs will use the grails-app/domain location as a hint to enable code completion.
<3> Implement the `MultiTenant` trait in the GORM entities you want to be regarded as multi tenant.

=== Data Service

http://gorm.grails.org/latest/hibernate/manual/index.html#dataServices[GORM Data Services] take the work out of implemented service layer logic by adding the ability to automatically implement abstract classes or interfaces using GORM logic.

source:BookService[app=books]

<1> Resolve the current tenant for the context of a class or method
<2> The `@Service` annotation is an AST transformation that will automatically implement the service for you.

=== Controller

Create a controller to expose the `/books` endpoint.

source:BookResponse[app=books]

source:BookController[app=books]

<1> Annotate with `io.micronaut.http.annotation.Controller` to designate a class as a Micronaut’s controller.
<2> Constructor dependency injection.

=== Bootstrap

To listen to an event, register a bean that implements `ApplicationEventListener` where the generic type is the type of event the listener should be executed for.

We want to listen for the `StartupEvent` to save some elements in the databases when the app starts:

source:Bootstrap[app=books]

<1> To register a Singleton in Micronaut’s application context, annotate your class with `javax.inject.Singleton`.
<2> Listen to `StartupEvent`.
<3> Field injection
<4> You can specify the tenant ID with the `Tenants.withId` method.

=== Book Tests

Create a tests which verifies the behaviour.
We received the books belonging to the tenant which we send via an HTTP header.

test:BookControllerSpec[app=books]

== Running the app

Run both microservices:

[source,bash]
----
books $ ./gradlew run
> Task :complete/books:run
18:29:26.500 [main] INFO  io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut - Startup completed in 671ms. Server Running: http://localhost:8081
<=========----> 75% EXECUTING [10s]
----

[source,bash]
----
gateway $ ./gradlew run

> Task :complete/gateway:run
18:28:35.723 [main] INFO  io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut - Startup completed in 707ms. Server Running: http://localhost:8080
----

You can visit `http://localhost:8080` and change tenant and see the book list change:
