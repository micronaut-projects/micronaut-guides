== Introduction

What is a dependency? Class A has a dependency on Class B when it interacts with it in any way. For example, Class A executes a method in an instance of Class B. You typically don't instantiate class dependencies when using Micronaut Framework's dependency injection engine. Instead, you rely on the framework to provide dependency instances.

NOTE: In Micronaut Framework documentation, we often use the term `Bean` and `Dependency` interchangeably.

== JSR-330

Micronaut Framework implements the https://javax-inject.github.io/javax-inject/[JSR-330 - Dependency Injection for Java specification].
 
== jakarta.inject vs javax.inject
 
Early versions of Micronaut Framework used `javax.inject` annotations. Due to trademark restrictions imposed on the `javax.*` namespace, the Micronaut framework switched from the `javax.inject` to the `jakarta.inject` annotations. Since version https://micronaut.io/2021/03/09/micronaut-2-4-released/[Micronaut Framework 2.4] supports `jakarta.inject` annotations. Moreover, Micronaut Framework switched to `jakarta.inject` as the set of annotations included by default with the Framework, and we strongly encourage you to use `jakarta.inject` moving forward.

== Dependency Injection Types

Micronaut Framework offers three types of dependency injection:

=== Constructor Injection

In constructor-based injection, Micronaut Framework provides the dependencies required for the class as arguments to the constructor.

source:constructor/MessageController[]

If your class has multiple constructors, the Micronaut framework searches for one constructor annotated with `jakarta.inject.Inject`.  

=== Field Injection

With field injection, Micronaut fulfills the injection endpoints for fields annotated with `jakarta.inject.Inject`.

source:field/MessageController[]

Field injection makes it harder to understand a class's requirements, making it easier to get a `NullPointerException` when testing a class using Field Injection. We recommend you use <<Benefits of Constructor Injection, Constructor Injection>>.

WARNING: The previous code sample uses a field with the default access modifier. There are four types of access modifies available in Java:  `private`, `protected`, `public`, and the default. Field injection works with all of them. However,  Field injection in a field with `private` access modifier requires reflection. Thus, we recommend you not to use `private`.  

NOTE: You use field injection in test classes annotated with `MicronautTest`. Micronaut does not instantiate the test class. Thus, you cannot use Constructor Injection in those classes.

NOTE: When using https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-spring/latest/guide/[Micronaut for Spring], you can also use Spring's `@Autowired` annotation for field injection. To learn more, read the guide: https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/micronaut-spring-boot.html[Run a Spring Boot application as a Micronaut application].

=== Method parameter injection

For method parameter injection, you define a method with one or more parameters and annotate the method with the `jakarta.inject.Inject` annotation.

source:methodparameter/MessageController[]

=== Benefits of Constructor Injection

When possible, we recommend you use Constructor Injection for several reasons:

**Clear Contract**

Constructor injection clearly expresses the requirements of the class and requires no additional annotation.

**Immutability**

Constructor injection allows you to define `final` dependencies. Thus, creating immutable objects.

**Identifying code smells**

Constructor injection helps you easily identify if your bean depends on too many other objects.

**Testing**

Constructor injection simplifies writing both unit and integration tests. The constructor forces us to provide valid objects for all dependencies. 
Thus, it decreases the chance of a NullPointerException occurrence during testing.
