In this guide, you will use Micronaut caching annotations to speed up your application.

You are going to use a cache powered by https://hazelcast.com[Hazelcast].

____
Hazelcast is a streaming and memory-first application platform for fast, stateful, data-intensive workloads on-premises, at the edge, or as fully managed cloud service.

NOTE: If you use https://launch.micronaut.io[Micronaut Launch], select "Micronaut Application" as application type and add `cache-hazelcast` and `testcontainers` features.

=== Configure the Application

In this sample application, we cache news headlines. Add the https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-cache/latest/guide/#hazelcast[Micronaut Hazelcast] dependency, which adds support for cache using http://hazelcast.com[Hazelcast].

dependency:micronaut-cache-hazelcast[groupId=io.micronaut.cache]

Configure your caches in `application.yml`:

resource:application.yml[tag=config]

<1> Configure a cache called `headlines`.

TIP: Check the https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-cache/latest/guide/configurationreference.html#io.micronaut.cache.caffeine.DefaultCacheConfiguration[properties (`maximum-size`, `expire-after-write` and `expire-after-access`)] to configure the size and expiration of your caches. It is important to keep the caches' size under control.

=== Micronaut Cache API

Imagine a service that retrieves headlines for a given month. Depending on the exact retrieval operation (e.g., accessing a database or making an HTTP call), it may be expensive, and you would want to cache it.

source:NewsService[]

callout:singleton[1]
<2> Specifies the cache name `headlines` to store cache operation values in.
<3> Indicates a method is cacheable. The cache name `headlines` specified in `@CacheConfig` is used. Since the method has a single parameter, you don't need to specify the `month` parameters attribute of the annotation.
<4> Emulate an expensive operation by sleeping for several seconds.
<5> The return value is cached with name `headlines` for the supplied `month`. The method invocation is never skipped, even if the cache `headlines` for the supplied `month` already exists.
<6> Method invocation causes the invalidation of the cache `headlines` for the supplied `month`.

TIP: If you don't annotate the class with `@CacheConfig`, specify the cache name in the cache annotations. E.g., `@Cacheable(value = "headlines", parameters = {"month"})`

=== Test the Cache

We use https://testcontainers.org[Testcontainers] to test the application.

Create a class to ease the start-up and shutdown of Hazelcast with TestContainers.

test:HazelcastUtils[]

We can verify that the cache works as expected:

test:NewsServiceTest[]

:exclude-for-languages:groovy
callout:test-method-order[1]
callout:micronaut-test-start-application-false[2]
callout:test-instance-per-class[3]
callout:test-property-provider[4]
<5> Inject `NewsService` bean.
callout:timeout[6]
callout:order[7]
:exclude-for-languages:

:exclude-for-languages:java,kotlin
callout:stepwise[1]
callout:micronaut-test-start-application-false[2]
callout:test-property-provider[3]
<4> Inject `NewsService` bean.
callout:timeout[5]
:exclude-for-languages:

=== Controller

Create a controller that engages the previous service:

source:News[]

callout:introspected[1]

source:NewsController[]

callout:controller[number=1,arg0=/]

Add a test. We call the endpoint twice and verify with the `@Timeout` annotation that the cache is being used.

test:NewsControllerTest[]

:exclude-for-languages:groovy
callout:test-method-order[1]
callout:micronaut-test[2]
callout:test-instance-per-class[3]
callout:test-property-provider[4]
callout:http-client[5]
callout:timeout[6]
callout:order[7]
:exclude-for-languages:

:exclude-for-languages:java,kotlin
callout:stepwise[1]
callout:micronaut-test[2]
callout:test-property-provider[3]
callout:http-client[4]
callout:timeout[5]
:exclude-for-languages:

common:testApp.adoc[]

=== Configure Hazelcast 

The minimal configuration to use Hazelcast is to simply declare `hazelcast:` with a network configuration for addresses of the Hazelcast cluster:

resource:application.yml[tag=hazelcast]

Replace `192.168.4.67` with your host machine address. See following section.

== Running Hazelcast via Docker 

Run https://hub.docker.com/r/hazelcast/hazelcast[Hazelcast via Docker]

Create a Hazelcast cluster with two Docker containers and access it from the client application.

[source, bash]
----
docker run -e HZ_NETWORK_PUBLICADDRESS=192.168.4.67:5701 -p 5701:5701 hazelcast/hazelcast:4.2.1
----
[source, bash]
----
docker run -e HZ_NETWORK_PUBLICADDRESS=192.168.4.67:5702 -p 5702:5701 hazelcast/hazelcast:4.2.1
----

Replace `192.168.4.67` with your host machine address. It is used for the Hazelcast communication.

common:runapp.adoc[]

You should be able to execute `curl localhost:8080/NOVEMBER` and see results
