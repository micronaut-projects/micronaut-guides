== Oracle Cloud Identity Domain

To provide authentication, sign in to your https://www.oracle.com/cloud/sign-in.html[Oracle Cloud] account and create an https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/domains/overview.htm[Identity Domains].

Copy the domain URL from the Identity Domain page. Obtain the client ID and Client secret from the Integrated applications / OAuth Configuration section.

Define the following environment variables:

[source, bash]
----
export OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=XXXXXXXXXX
export OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=YYYYYYYYYY
export OAUTH_ISSUER=https://idcs-xxx.identity.oraclecloud.com/
----

=== OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow

We want to use an **Authorization Code** grant type flow which it is described in the following diagram:

common:create-app.adoc[]

common:micronaut-views-thymeleaf.adoc[]

=== OAuth 2.0

To use OAuth 2.0 integration, add the following dependency:

dependency:micronaut-security-oauth2[groupId=io.micronaut.security]

Also add https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/#jwt[Micronaut JWT support] dependencies:

dependency:micronaut-security-jwt[groupId=io.micronaut.security]

==== OAuth 2.0 Configuration

Add the following OAuth2 Configuration:

resource:application.properties[tag=oauth2]

callout:authentication-idtoken[arg0=oci]
callout:oauth2-client-name[arg0=oci]
<3> Client ID. You can obtain it in the Oracle Cloud Console: `Identity Domain` / `Integrated applications` / `OAuth Configuration` section.
<4> Client Secret. You can obtain it in the Oracle Cloud Console: `Identity Domain` / `Integrated applications` / `OAuth Configuration` section.
<5> `issuer` URL. It allows the Micronaut framework to discover the configuration of the OpenID Connect server.
<6> Accept GET request to the `/logout` endpoint.

===== OpenID Auto Configuration

Upon application startup, the Micronaut application visits the https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/iam-domains-rest-api/op-well-known-openid-configuration-get.html[OpenID discovery endpoint]
to configure your application. if you set `micronaut.security.oauth2.clients.oci.openid.issuer` to `https://idcs-xxx.identity.oraclecloud.com/`, Micronaut visits `https://idcs-xxx.identity.oraclecloud.com/.well-known/openid-configuration` on startup.

===== Scopes Configuration

If you want to consider the Identity Domain User groups as your application roles, you can request the `get_groups` scope:

resource:application.properties[tag=scopes]

https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Resources/Assets/whitepapers/oci-iam-oauth-flows-best-practices.pdf[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure IAM
Identity Domain OAuth and OpenID Connect Flows and Best Practices]

____
When you’re using an OpenID Connect flow, often there’s a need for the application to get user groups. In OCI IAM,
you can request groups as part of the ID token or get an access token that’s eligible to fetch user groups. When you
request scope=get_groups in a request to the authorization endpoint, OCI IAM returns the user groups as part of the
ID token, which increases the size of the ID token. An alternative is to use scope=groups, which allows the returned
access token to get user groups from the userinfo endpoints. So, scope=get_groups saves an API call but increases
the ID token size.
____

You can create a https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#replaces[bean replacement] for a bean of type `RolesFinder`, to consider the user groups as roles:

source:IdentityDomainRolesFinder[]

callout:singleton[]

=== Home

Create a controller to handle the requests to `/`. You will display the email of the authenticated person if any. Annotate the controller endpoint with `@View` since we will use a Thymeleaf template.

source:HomeController[]

callout:controller[arg0=/]
callout:secured-anonymous[]
<3> Use https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/api/io/micronaut/views/View.html[View] annotation to specify which template to use to render the response.
<4> The @api@/io/micronaut/http/annotation/Get.html[@Get] annotation maps the `index` method to GET `/` requests.

Create a thymeleaf template:

resource:views/home.html[]

Also, note that we return an empty model in the controller. However, we are accessing `security` in the thymeleaf template.

- The https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/api/io/micronaut/views/model/security/SecurityViewModelProcessor.html[SecurityViewModelProcessor]
injects into the model a `security` map with the authenticated user.  See https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/guide/#security-model-enhancement[User in a view^] documentation.

=== Cleanup

Once you are done with this guide, delete the Oracle Cloud resources created (Identity Domains, Users) to avoid incurring unnecessary charges.
