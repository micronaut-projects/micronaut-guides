common:header.adoc[]

In this guide, we will create two microservices that will use https://www.rabbitmq.com/[RabbitMQ] to communicate with each other in an asynchronous and decoupled way.

____
RabbitMQ is an open-source message-broker software that originally implemented the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)
and has since been extended with a plug-in architecture to support Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP),
Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), and other protocols.

== Writing the application

Let's describe the microservices you will build through the guide.

* `books` - It returns a list of books. It uses a domain consisting of a book name and ISBN. It also publishes a message in
RabbitMQ every time a book is accessed.

* `analytics` - It connects to RabbitMQ to update the analytics for every book (a counter). It also exposes an endpoint
to get the analytics.

https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/micronaut-intellij-idea-ide-setup.html[Setup IntelliJ IDEA to develop Micronaut Applications].

=== Books microservice

Create the `books` microservice using the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#cli[Micronaut Command Line Interface] or with https://launch.micronaut.io[Micronaut Launch].

[source,bash]
----
mn @books:cli-command@ --features=rabbitmq,reactor,graalvm example.micronaut.books --build=@build@ --lang=@lang@
----

common:build-lang-arguments.adoc[]

If you use Micronaut Launch, select Micronaut Application as application type and add the `rabbitmq`, `reactor`, and `graalvm` features.

The previous command creates a directory named `books` and a Micronaut application inside it with default package `example.micronaut`.

Create a `BookController` class to handle incoming HTTP requests into the `books` microservice:

source:BookController[app=books]

callout:controller[number=1,arg0=/books]
<2> Inject `BookService` using constructor injection.
callout:get[number=3,arg0=listAll,arg1=/books]
callout:get[number=4,arg0=findBook,arg1=/books/{isbn}]

The previous controller responds a `List<Book>`. Create the `Book` POJO:

source:Book[app=books]

To keep this guide simple there is no database persistence, and the list of books is kept in memory in `BookService`:

source:BookService[app=books]

=== Analytics microservice

Create the `analytics` microservice using the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#cli[Micronaut Command Line Interface] or with https://launch.micronaut.io[Micronaut Launch].

[source,bash]
----
mn @analytics:cli-command@ --features=rabbitmq,graalvm example.micronaut.analytics --build=@build@ --lang=@lang@
----

common:build-lang-arguments.adoc[]

If you use Micronaut Launch, select Micronaut Application as application type and add the `kafka` and `graalvm` features.

To keep this guide simple there is no database persistence, and the books analytics is kept in memory in `AnalyticsService`:

source:AnalyticsService[app=analytics]

<1> Keep the books analytics in memory.
<2> Initialize and update the analytics for the book passed as parameter.
<3> Return all the analytics.

Create the `Book` POJO used by `AnalyticsService`:

source:Book[app=analytics]

The previous service responds a `List<BookAnalytics>`. Create the `BookAnalytics` POJO:

source:BookAnalytics[app=analytics]

Write a test:

test:AnalyticsServiceTest[app=analytics]

<1> `micronaut-test-junit5` is added automatically to `build.gradle` (or `pom.xml`) when creating an application with the CLI. For more information, see https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-test/latest/guide/[the documentation].
<2> Just inject the collaborator and `@MicronautTest` will take care of everything.

Create a Controller to expose the analytics:

source:AnalyticsController[app=analytics]

<1> Just expose the analytics.

[NOTE]
====
The application doesn't expose the method `updateBookAnalytics` created in `AnalyticsService`. This method will be invoked
when reading messages from RabbitMQ.
====

== Running the application

Run the `books` microservice:

:exclude-for-build:maven

[source,bash]
.books
----
./gradlew run
----

[source]

16:35:55.614 [main] INFO  io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut - Startup completed in 623ms. Server Running: http://localhost:8081
----

:exclude-for-build:

You can run `curl` commands to test the application:

[source, bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/books
----

[source,json]
----
[{"isbn":"1491950358","name":"Building Microservices"},{"isbn":"1680502395","name":"Release It!"},{"isbn":"0321601912","name":"Continuous Delivery"}]
----

[source, bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/books/1491950358
----

[source,json]
----
{"isbn":"1491950358","name":"Building Microservices"}
----

[source, bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8081/analytics
----

[source,json]
----
[]
----

Please note that getting the analytics returns an empty list because the applications are not communicating to each other (yet).

=== Books microservice

Via <<Test Resources>> the Micronaut application will connect to a RabbitMQ instance running inside Docker so it is not necessary to add anything to `application.yml`.
In case you want to change the configuration, add the following:

resource:application-prod.yml[app=books,tag=rabbitmq]

==== Create RabbitMQ exchange, queue and binding

Before being able to send and receive messages using RabbitMQ it is necessary to define the exchange, queue and binding.
One option is create them directly in the RabbitMQ Admin UI available on port 15672.

NOTE: Use `guest` for both username and password.

Another option is to create them programmatically.
Create the class `ChannelPoolListener`:

source:ChannelPoolListener[app=books]

<1> Define an exchange named `micronaut`. From the producer point of view everything is sent to the exchange with the appropriate routing key
<2> Define a queue named `analytics`. The consumer will listen for messages in that queue.
<3> Define a binding between the exchange and the queue using the routing key `analytics`.

==== Create RabbitMQ client (producer)

Let's create an interface to send messages to RabbitMQ. The Micronaut framework will implement the interface at compilation time:

source:AnalyticsClient[app=books]

<1> Set the exchange used to send the messages.
<2> Set the routing key.
<3> Send the `Book` POJO. The Micronaut framework will automatically convert it to JSON before sending it.

==== Send Analytics information automatically

Sending a message to RabbitMQ is as simple as injecting `AnalyticsClient` and calling `updateAnalytics` method. The goal
is to do it automatically every time a book is returned, i.e., every time there is a call to `\http://localhost:8080/books/{isbn}`.
To achieve this we will create an https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#filters[Http Server Filter].
Create the `AnalyticsFilter` class:

source:AnalyticsFilter[app=books]

<1> Annotate the class with `@Filter` and define the ANT Matcher pattern to intercept all the calls to the desire URI.
<2> The class needs to implement `HttpServerFilter`.
<3> Constructor injection for RabbitMQ `AnalyticsClient`.
<4> Override `doFilter` method.
<5> Execute the request. This will call the controller action.
<6> Get the response from the controller and return the body as a `Book`.
<7> If the book is found, use RabbitMQ client to send a message.

=== Analytics microservice

==== Create RabbitMQ exchange, queue and binding

As we already did in Books Microservice, let's create the class `ChannelPoolListener` to define the exchange, queue
and binding:

source:ChannelPoolListener[app=analytics]

TIP: Instead of copy-paste the class in every project it would be better to create a new Gradle (or Maven) module and
share it among all the microservices.

==== Create RabbitMQ consumer

Create a new class to act as a consumer of the messages sent to RabbitMQ by the Books Microservice. The Micronaut framework will
implement the consumer at compile time. Create `AnalyticsListener`:

source:AnalyticsListener[app=analytics]

<1> Do not load this bean for the test environment. This enable us to run the tests without having a RabbitMQ instance running.
<2> Annotate the class with `@RabbitListener` to indicate that this bean will consume messages from RabbitMQ.
<3> Constructor injection for `AnalyticsService`.
<4> Annotate the method with `@Queue`. This listener will listen to messages in `analytics` queue.
<5> Call the previously created method to update the analytics for the book.

=== Running the application

Run `books` microservice:

:exclude-for-build:maven

[source,bash]
.books
----
./gradlew run
----

[source]
----
16:35:55.614 [main] INFO  io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut - Startup completed in 576ms. Server Running: http://localhost:8080
----

:exclude-for-build:

:exclude-for-build:gradle

[source,bash]
.books
----
./mvnw mn:run
----

[source]
----
16:35:55.614 [main] INFO  io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut - Startup completed in 576ms. Server Running: http://localhost:8080
----

:exclude-for-build:

Execute a `curl` request to get one book:

[source, bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/books/1491950358
----

[source,json]
----
{"isbn":"1491950358","name":"Building Microservices"}
----

Open RabbitMQ Admin UI on http://localhost:15672 and use `guest` for both username and password. Select `queues` and
`analytics` queue. You can see that there is a message in the queue.

image::rabbitmq-message.png[]

Expand the "Get messages" option and get one message. You can see all the information: `exchange`, `routing key, and the
`payload` serialized to JSON:

image::rabbitmq-message-detail.png[]

Run `analytics` microservice:

:exclude-for-build:maven

[source,bash]
.analytics
----
./gradlew run
----

[source]
----
16:35:55.614 [main] INFO  io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut - Startup completed in 623ms. Server Running: http://localhost:8081
----

:exclude-for-build:

:exclude-for-build:gradle

[source,bash]
.analytics
----
./mvnw mn:run
----

[source]
----
16:35:55.614 [main] INFO  io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut - Startup completed in 623ms. Server Running: http://localhost:8081
----

:exclude-for-build:

The application will consume and process the message automatically after the startup. Go to RabbitMQ Admin UI and check that the message has been consumed:

image::rabbitmq-message-consumed.png[]

Now, run a `curl` to get the analytics:

[source, bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8081/analytics
----

[source,json]
----
[{"bookIsbn":"1491950358","count":1}]
----

common:graal-with-plugins.adoc[]

:exclude-for-languages:groovy

Start the native executables for the two microservices and run the same `curl` request as before to check that everything works with GraalVM.
