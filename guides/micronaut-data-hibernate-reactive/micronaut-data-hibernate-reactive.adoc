In this guide, we will write a Micronaut application that exposes some REST endpoints and stores data in a database using JPA and Hibernate.

common:requirements.adoc[]

common:completesolution.adoc[]

common:create-app.adoc[]

=== Data Source configuration

Add the following dependencies:

:dependencies:

dependency:micronaut-data-hibernate-reactive[groupId=io.micronaut.data,callout=1]
dependency:vertx-mysql-client[groupId=io.vertx,callout=2]

:dependencies:

<1> A dependency on micronaut-data's Reactive Hibernate support.
<2> Adds a dependency to the Vert.x MySQL client.

=== JPA configuration

Add the next snippet to `src/main/resources/application.yml` to configure JPA:

resource:application.yml[tag=jpa]

<1> Configure the package that contains our entity classes.
<2> Configure how Hibernate will manage the database.

Use `none` for the hbm2ddl option to prevent Hibernate from creating the database schema, as we will be using Flyway to manage the database.

common:flyway-header.adoc[]

We also will need to define a JDBC datasource for the migration (as it cannot use the reactive JPA datasource <<JPA configuration,configured above>>)
So first add these dependencies:

:dependencies:

dependency:micronaut-jdbc-hikari[groupId=io.micronaut.sql,callout=1]
dependency:mysql-connector-java[groupId=mysql,callout=2,scope=runtime]

:dependencies:

<1> A dependency on micronaut-jdbc's Hikari datasource.
<2> Adds a dependency to the MySQL Connector/J driver.

Then add the following configuration for both Flyway and the Datasource

resource:application.yml[tag=flyway]

<1> Define the JDBC URL for your database.
<2> Define the username and password for your database.
<3> Define the driver class name for your database.
<4> Enable Flyway for the `migration` datasource.

NOTE: Configuring multiple data sources is as simple as enabling Flyway for each one.
You can also specify folders that will be used for migrating each data source.
Review the https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-flyway/latest/guide/[Micronaut Flyway documentation] for additional details.

Flyway migration will be automatically triggered before your Micronaut application starts.
Flyway will read migration commands in the `resources/db/migration/` directory, execute them if necessary, and verify that the configured data source is consistent with them.

Create the following migration files with the database schema creation:

resource:db/migration/V1__schema.sql[]

During application startup, http://www.flyway.org[Flyway] executes the SQL file and creates the schema needed for the application.

=== Domain

Create the domain entities:

source:domain/Genre[]

=== Repository Access

Next, create a repository interface to define the operations to access the database. Micronaut Data will implement the interface at compilation time:

source:GenreRepository[]

<1> Annotate with `@Repository` to allow compile time implementations to be added.
<2> `Genre`, the entity to treat as the root entity for the purposes of querying, is established either from the method signature or from the generic type parameter specified to the `GenericRepository` interface.

The repository extends from `ReactorPageableRepository`. It inherits the hierarchy `ReactorPageableRepository` -> `ReactorCrudRepository` -> `GenericRepository`.

|===
|Repository | Description

|`ReactorPageableRepository`
| A reactive repository that supports pagination. It provides `findAll(Pageable)` and `findAll(Sort)`.

|`ReactorCrudRepository`
| A repository interface for performing reactive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). It provides methods such as `findAll()`, `save(Genre)`, `deleteById(Long)`, and `findById(Long)`.

|`GenericRepository`
| A root interface that features no methods but defines the entity type and ID type as generic arguments.

|===

=== Controller

common:validation.adoc[]

Create a class to encapsulate the Update operations:

source:GenreUpdateCommand[]

callout:introspected[1]

Create `GenreController`, a controller that exposes a resource with the common CRUD operations:

source:GenreController[]

callout:controller[number=1,arg0=/genres]
callout:constructor-di[number=2,arg0=GenreRepository]
<3> Maps a `GET` request to `/genres/{id}`, which attempts to show a genre. This illustrates the use of a URL path variable.
<4> Returning an empty optional when the genre doesn't exist makes the Micronaut framework respond with 404 (not found).
<5> Maps a `PUT` request to `/genres`, which attempts to update a genre.
<6> Adds `@Valid` to any method parameter that requires validation. Use a POJO supplied as a JSON payload in the request to populate command.
<7> It is easy to add custom headers to the response.
<8> Maps a `GET` request to `/genres/list`, which returns a list of genres. This mapping illustrates URL parameters being mapped to a single POJO.
<9> You can bind `Pageable` as a controller method argument. Check the examples in the following test section and read the https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-data/latest/guide/configurationreference.html#io.micronaut.data.runtime.config.DataConfiguration.PageableConfiguration[Pageable configuration] options. For example, you can configure the default page size with the configuration property `micronaut.data.pageable.default-page-size`.
<10> Maps a `POST` request to `/genres`, which attempts to save a genre.
<11> Maps a `POST` request to `/ex`, which generates an exception.
<12> Maps a `DELETE` request to `/genres/{id}`, which attempts to remove a genre. This illustrates the use of a URL path variable.

=== Writing Tests

To allow us to run a MySQL instance in a Docker container for testing, create a base class that sets this up.

test:BaseMysqlTest[]

callout:micronaut-test[1]
callout:test-instance-per-class[2]
callout:test-property-provider[3]
callout:http-client[4]
<5> Configure the application properties to that of the MySQL instance.

To define the username and password for our Testcontainers MySQL instance, create a `application-test.yml` file in `src/test/resources`:

testResource:application-test.yml[]

Create a test to verify the CRUD operations:

test:GenreControllerTest[]

<1> Extend the `BaseMysqlTest` class.
callout:http-request[2]
<2> If you care just about the object in the response use `retrieve`.
<3> Sometimes, receiving just the object is not enough and you need information about the response. In this case, instead of `retrieve` you should use the `exchange` method.

common:testApp.adoc[]

== Using MySQL

To run the application, we will use a real database instance running in Docker.

Start it with:

[source,bash]
----
docker run \
    --rm \
    -d \
    -p 3306:3306 \
    -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw \
    -e MYSQL_DATABASE=db \
    mysql:latest
----

When you move to production, you will need to configure these properties to point at your real production database.
This can be done via environment variables like so:

[source,bash]
----
export JDBC_URL=jdbc:mysql://production-server:3306/micronaut
export JDBC_USER=dbuser
export JDBC_PASSWORD=theSecretPassword
----

Run the application.
If you look at the output you can see that the application uses MySQL:

common:runapp.adoc[]

[source, bash]
----
..
...
16:31:01.155 [main] INFO  org.hibernate.dialect.Dialect - HHH000400: Using dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect
....
----

Connect to your MySQL database, and you will see both `genre` and `book` tables.

Save one genre, and your `genre` table will now contain an entry.

[source, bash]
----
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8080/genres" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{ "name": "music" }'
----
