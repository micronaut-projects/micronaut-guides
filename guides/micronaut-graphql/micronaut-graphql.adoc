== Getting Started

In this guide, we will create a Micronaut application written in @language@ that uses https://graphql.org/[GraphQL] to expose some data.

____
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides
a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they
need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

common:create-app.adoc[]

== GraphQL

Add the following dependency:

dependency:micronaut-graphql[groupId=io.micronaut.graphql]

By default GraphQL endpoint `/graphql` is enabled so you don't need to add any extra configuration.

=== Describe your schema

Create the file `schema.graphqls` in `src/main/resources` directory:

resource:schema.graphqls[]

<1> Declare a `bookById` query
<2> Declare a `Book` type
<3> Declare an `Author` type

=== Book and Author classes

Create `Book` and `Author` classes that will mimic the data we want to expose:

source:Book[]

source:Author[]

=== Data repository

To keep this example simple, instead of retrieving the information from a database we will keep it in memory and just return it from there. In a real-world example you will use any external storage: relational database, SQL database, etc.

Create `DbRepository`

source:DbRepository[]

<1> These are the only books we have in our system.

=== Data Fetchers

With a Data Fetcher we bind the GraphQL schema, and our domain model and execute the appropiate queries in our datastore
to retrieve the requested data.

Create class `GraphQLDataFetchers`

source:GraphQLDataFetchers[]

<1> Constructor injection for the `DbRepository` bean
<2> Return a GraphQL `dataFetchingEnvironment` with the information about the query
<3> Get the `id` parameter from the query
<4> Access the repository to find the book. Remember that this should be backed by a real datastore
<5> Get the Book related to a specific author
<6> Get the Author
<7> Access the repository to find the Author.

=== Factory

Create the following factory that will bind the GraphQL schema to the code and types.

source:GraphQLFactory[]

<1> Annotate the class with `@Factory` so the Micronaut framework knows that this class will create beans
<2> Create a new `SchemaParser`
<3> Get the previously created `schema.graphqls` file from the classpath
<4> Parse the schema
<5> Create the runtime wiring
<6> Bind a data fetcher for the `bookById` query
<7> Bind a data fetcher to retrieve the author related to a book
<8> Create the executable schema
<9> Return the GraphQL bean

common:runapp.adoc[]

We want to execute a GraphQL query to retrieve a book by its id:

[source,json]
----
query {
  bookById(id:"book-1") {
    name,
    pageCount,
    author {
      firstName
      lastName
    },
  }
}
----

Run the  following curl request:

[source, bash]
----
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/graphql' \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data-binary '{"query":"{ bookById(id:\"book-1\") { name, pageCount, author { firstName, lastName} } }"}'
----

[source,json]
----
{"data":{"bookById":{"name":"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","pageCount":223,"author":{"firstName":"Joanne","lastName":"Rowling"}}}}
----

One of the nice features about GraphQL is that the client can decide the fields, and the order they want to retrieve. Now we send the following request:

[source, bash]
----
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/graphql' \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data-binary '{"query":"{ bookById(id:\"book-1\") { pageCount, name, id } }"}'
----

[source,json]
----
{"data":{"bookById":{"pageCount":223,"name":"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","id":"book-1"}}}
----

Notice that now the application only responds with `pageCount`, `name` and `id` fields, in that order.

== Test the application

For testing the application we will use Micronaut HTTP Client to send a `POST` request to the `/graphql` endpoint.
Create the following class:

test:GraphQLControllerTest[]

To run the tests:

:exclude-for-build:maven

[source, bash]
----
./gradlew test
----

Then open `build/reports/tests/test/index.html` in a browser to see the results.

:exclude-for-build:

:exclude-for-build:gradle

[source, bash]
----
./mvnw test
----

:exclude-for-build:

== GraphiQL

As an extra feature that will help you during development, you can enable https://github.com/graphql/graphiql[GraphiQL].
GraphiQL is the GraphQL integrated development environment, and it helps to execute GraphQL queries.

It should only be used for development, so it's not enabled by default. Add the following configuration to enable it:

resource:application.yml[tag=graphiql]

Start the application again and open http://localhost:8080/graphiql in your browser. You can write your GraphQL queries
with integrated auto-completion and execute them to get the results in an easier and nicer way:

image:graphiql-01.png[]

common:graal-with-plugins.adoc[]

:exclude-for-languages:groovy

Start the native image and execute the same curl request as before. You can also use the included GraphiQL browser to
execute the queries.

:exclude-for-languages:
