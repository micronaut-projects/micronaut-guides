=== Thymeleaf template

Create a Thymeleaf template in `src/main/resources/views/index.html`:

resource:views/index.html[]

<1> Include the CSS file from our static assets
<2> Include a PNG from our static assets
<3> Use the `th:text` attribute to set the element's text

== Message service

Create an interface which describes our message service.

source:MessageService[]

And then create a default implementation of the service.

source:MyMessageService[]

<1> callout:singleton[]

== Controller

Create a controller that takes a name and generates our templated HTML page.

source:MainController[]]

<1> callout:controller[arg0=/]
<2> callout:injection[arg0=MessageService]
<3> callout:view[]
<4> callout:get[arg0=sayHello,arg1=/hello/{name}]
<5> callout:constraints[]

== Assets

Then create a static CSS file in `src/main/resources/static/css/style.css`:

resource:static/css/style.css[]

And a static PNG file in `src/main/resources/static/images/micronaut_stacked_black.png`:

image:micronaut_stacked_black.png[width=253]

=== Configuration

We can then add a static-mapping to our `application.properties` so that any missing requests are attempted to be resolved from the static assets.

First configure a route `/css/*.css` to map any routes matching that pattern to be mapped to the `static/css` resources.

resource:application.properties[tag=css-assets]

- The first line matches any request to the server that does not match a controller route.
- The second line defines that the classpath inside a root static directory should be searched for the resource.

This means that a request to `/css/style.css` will be resolved to `src/main/resources/static/css/style.css` (if that resource exists and there is no matching controller path).

And then configure a route `/images/**` to be mapped to the `static/images` resources.
We use a wildcard here as images may have different file extensions.

resource:application.properties[tag=image-assets]

This means that a request to `/images/some/image.png` will be resolved to `src/main/resources/static/images/some/image.png` (if that resource exists and there is no matching controller path).

=== A note on wildcard mappings

The framework searches for every request a controller route; if not found, it searches for a static resource.
In the above configuration, we could have used a single wildcard mapping for all assets similar to:

[source,properties]
.A wasteful wildcard example
----
micronaut.router.static-resources.assets.mapping=/**
micronaut.router.static-resources.assets.paths=classpath\:static
----

However, searching for a static resource in every request is a waste.
We know specific paths (e.g., `/bogus`) will not match any resource.

Therefore, as we only want to search for static resources for paths starting with `/css` or `/images`, we can limit our static resource mappings to these paths.

== Testing

Create a test that verifies the MessageService is working as expected.

test:MessageServiceTest[]

callout:micronaut-test[]
<2> Inject the `MessageService` bean.

And another that verifies the generated HTML contains the expected text.

test:MainControllerTest[]

<1> callout:micronaut-test[]
<2> callout:http-client[]

And another that verifies the static resources are returned on the expected URLs.

test:StaticResourceTest[]

<1> callout:micronaut-test[]
<2> callout:http-client[]

common:runapp.adoc[]

Visit http://localhost:8080/hello/Micronaut and the browser displays our templated HTML page with styling and an image.
