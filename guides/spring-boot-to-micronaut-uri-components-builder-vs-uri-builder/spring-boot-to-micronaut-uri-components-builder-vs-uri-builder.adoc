== Introduction

While developing web applications, we often need to build URIs. For example, to create redirection responses. In this article, we compare two similar APIs - Spring
https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/util/UriComponentsBuilder.html[`UriComponentsBuilder`] and Micronaut https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/http/uri/UriBuilder.html[UriBuilder].

== SpringBoot `UriComponentsBuilder`

test:UriComponentsBuilderTest[app=springboot]

== Micronaut `UriBuilder`

As you can see in the following code snippet, the API is similar. You should be able to migrate easily.

test:UriBuilderTest[app=micronautframework]
