== Introduction

Please read about https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/guide/#lambda[Micronaut AWS Lambda Support] to learn more about different Lambda runtime, Triggers, and Handlers, and how to integrate with a Micronaut application.

The biggest problem with Java applications and Lambda is how to mitigate Cold startups. Executing GraalVM Native executables of a Micronaut function in a Lambda Custom runtime is a solution to this problem.

If you want to respond to triggers such as queue events, S3 events, or single endpoints, you should opt to code your Micronaut functions as Serverless functions.

== Getting Started

In this guide, we will deploy a Micronaut function written in @language@ as a GraalVM Native executable to an AWS Lambda custom runtime.

== Writing the Application

common:cli-or-launch.adoc[]

[source,bash]
----
mn create-function-app example.micronaut.micronautguide --features=graalvm,aws-lambda --build=@build@ --lang=@lang@
----

common:build-lang-arguments.adoc[]

common:default-package.adoc[]

NOTE: If you use https://launch.micronaut.io[Micronaut Launch], select `Serverless function` as application type and add the `graalvm` and `aws-lambda` features.

https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/micronaut-intellij-idea-ide-setup.html[Setup IntelliJ IDEA to develop Micronaut Applications].

== Code

The generated project contains sample code. Let's explore it.

The application contains a class extending https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/api/io/micronaut/function/aws/MicronautRequestHandler.html[MicronautRequestHandler]

source:FunctionRequestHandler[]

* The class extends https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/api/io/micronaut/function/aws/MicronautRequestHandler.html[MicronautRequestHandler] and defines input and output types.

The generated test shows how to verify the function behaviour:

test:FunctionRequestHandlerTest[]

* When you instantiate the Handler, the application context starts.
* Remember to close your application context when you end your test. You can use your handler to obtain it.
* Invoke the `execute` method of the handler.

== Lambda

Create a Lambda Function. As a runtime, select `Custom Runtime`

=== Upload Code

The Micronaut framework eases the deployment of your functions as a https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html[Custom AWS Lambda runtime].

The main API you will interact with is https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/api/io/micronaut/function/aws/runtime/AbstractMicronautLambdaRuntime.html[AbstractMicronautLambdaRuntime]. This is an abstract class which you can subclass to create your custom runtime `mainClass`. That class includes the code to perform the 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html#runtimes-custom-build[Processing Tasks] described in the Custom Runtime documentation.

The generated project contains such a class:

source:FunctionLambdaRuntime[]

common:build-native-lambda.adoc[]

Once you have a ZIP file, upload it

=== Handler

The handler used is the one created at `FunctionLambdaRuntime`.

Thus, you don't need to specify the handler in the AWS Lambda console.

However, I like to specify it in the console as well:

`example.micronaut.FunctionRequestHandler`
