=== Controller

Create `MailController` which use a collaborator, `emailService` to send and email.

source:MailController[]

callout:controller[number=1,arg0=/mail/send]
<2> Constructor injection
<3> The @api@/io/micronaut/http/annotation/Post.html[@Post] annotation maps the index method to all requests that use an HTTP POST
<4> Add `@Valid` to any method parameter which requires validation. Use a POGO supplied as a JSON payload in the request to populate the email.
<5> Return 200 OK as the result

The previous controller uses a POJO supplied in the request body as a JSON Payload

source:EmailCmd[tags=clazz|properties|settersandgetters]

=== Email Service

Create an interface - `EmailService`. Any email provider present in the application should implement it.

source:EmailService[]

source:Email[]

==== AWS SES

____
Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) is a cloud-based email sending service designed to help digital marketers and
application developers send marketing, notification, and transactional emails. It is a reliable, cost-effective service
for businesses of all sizes that use email to keep in contact with their customers.
____

Add a dependency to AWS SES SDK:

dependency:ses[groupId=software.amazon.awssdk,version=@sesVersion@]

Create service which uses AWS Simple Email Service client to send the email

source:AwsSesMailService[]

callout:singleton[1]
<2> Bean will not loaded unless condition is met.
<3> In case of multiple possible interface implementations of `EmailService`, `@Secondary` reduces the priority.
<4> Values for region and source email are resolved from environment variables or system properties.

We annotated the previous class with `@Requires(condition = AwsResourceAccessCondition.class)`.

The `AwsResourceAccessCondition` ensures the bean is not loaded unless certain conditions are fulfilled.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/java-dg-roles.html[_Configure IAM Roles for Amazon EC2_]

____
> If your application creates an AWS client using the create method, the client searches for credentials using the default credentials provider chain, in the following order:

> * In the Java system properties: `aws.accessKeyId` and `aws.secretAccessKey`.
> * In system environment variables: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
> * In the default credentials file (the location of this file varies by platform).
> * n the Amazon ECS environment variable: `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI`.
> * In the instance profile credentials, which exist within the instance metadata associated with the IAM role for the EC2 instance.
____

source:AwsResourceAccessCondition[]

Add a test to verify the service is loaded:

test:AwsSesMailServiceTest[]

==== SendGrid

https://sendgrid.com/[SendGrid] is a transactional email service.

____
SendGrid is responsible for sending billions of emails for some of the best and brightest companies in the world.
____

Add a dependency to SendGrid SDK:

dependency:sendgrid-java[groupId=com.sendgrid,version=@sendgrid-javaVersion@]

Create a service which encapsulates the integration with SendGrid. The bean will not be loaded if the
system properties (`sendgrid.apikey`, `sendgrid.fromemail`) or environment variables (`SENDGRID_APIKEY`, `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL`) are not present.

source:SendGridEmailCondition[]

Add a test:

test:SendGridEmailConditionTest[]

source:SendGridEmailService[]

callout:singleton[1]
<2> Bean will not loaded unless condition is met.
<3> Values will be resolved from system properties.

Add a test:

test:SendGridEmailServiceTest[]

=== Run the application

Add a logger to get more visibility:

resource:logback.xml[tag=logger]

To use SendGrid, define the required environment variables and run the application.

[source, bash]
----
$ export SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=email@email.com
$ export SENDGRID_APIKEY=XXXXXX
:exclude-for-build:maven
./gradlew run
:exclude-for-build:
:exclude-for-build:gradle
./mvnw mn:run
:exclude-for-build:
----

To use AWS SES, define the required environment variables and run the application.

[source, bash]
----
$ export AWS_REGION=eu-west-1
$ export AWS_SOURCE_EMAIL=email@email.com
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXX
$ export AWS_SECRET_KEY=XXXXXXXX
:exclude-for-build:maven
./gradlew run
:exclude-for-build:
:exclude-for-build:gradle
./mvnw mn:run
:exclude-for-build:
----

If you supply both AWS SES and SendGrid  system properties, the SendGrid `EmailService` implementation will be used due to the `@Secondary` annotation in `AwsSesMailService`.

[source,bash]
----
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8080/mail/send" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
-d $'{
"subject": "Test Email",
"recipient": "recipient@email.com",
"textBody": "Foo"
}'
----

=== Test

In our acceptance test, beans `SendGridEmailService` or `AwsSesMailService` will not be loaded since system properties are not present.

Instead, we set up a Mock which we can verify interactions against.

test:MockEmailService[]

Create the next test:

test:MailControllerTest[]

callout:micronaut-test[1]
callout:property[2]
<3> Inject the `ApplicationContext` bean
callout:http-client[4]
callout:http-request[5]
<6> `emailService.send` method is invoked once.

=== Validation

We want to ensure any email request contains a subject, recipient and a text body or html body.

common:validation.adoc[]

Create the next test:

test:MailControllerValidationTest[]

callout:micronaut-test[1]
<2> Define a property available for the application.
callout:http-request[3]

In order to satisfy the test, create an email constraints annotation

source:EmailConstraints[]

and a constraint validator in a `@Factory` class:

source:EmailConstraintsFactory[]

Annotate `EmailCmd` with `EmailConstraints` and `@Introspected` (to generate the
https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#introspection[Bean Introspection information]).
