=== Configuration

If you want to send every email with the same address, you can set it via configuration:

common:yaml-dependency.adoc[]

resource:application.yml[tag=mail]

This is possible thanks to https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-email/latest/guide/index.html#decorators[Email Decorators].
