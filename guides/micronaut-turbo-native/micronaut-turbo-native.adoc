== Android client

An example Android client can be found https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-android/tree/main/demo[Hotwired's GitHub repository].

In order that it points to your Micronaut version for the backend (instead of the one provided by Hotwire), you will need to https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-android/blob/190607907e814282e97c2d3c3f5fe75ee65c48ba/demo/src/main/kotlin/dev/hotwire/turbo/demo/util/Constants.kt#L3[modify the `BASE_URL` in `Constants.kt`] to point to your Micronaut instance.

NOTE: Ensure the URL does not end with a slash.

You will then be able to run this app locally (or on a real device), and see the results:

== iOS Demo App

https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-ios/tree/main/Demo[Clone or Download the demo IOS app].

Once the Micronaut application is running, then you just need to change `Demo.current` to use `local` in `Demo/Demo.swift` to point to the local version of the demo. Edit the port to match the port used by the Micronaut application.

[source,swift]
----
...
struct Demo {
    ...
    static let local = URL(string: "http://localhost:8080")!
    static let turbolinks5Local = URL(string: "http://localhost:8080?turbolinks=1")!

    static var current: URL {
        local
    }
}
----

NOTE: Ensure the URL does not end with a slash.

You will then be able to run this app locally (or on a real device), and see the results:
