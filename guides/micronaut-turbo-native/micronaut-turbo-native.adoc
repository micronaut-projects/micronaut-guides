== Getting Started

This guide, written in @language@, presents a server which uses Turbo to give a native feel for a mobile client application that views it.

https://turbo.hotwired.dev/[Turbo] is a javascript framework which dramatically reduces the amount of custom JavaScript that most web applications will need to write.

Turbo integration is part of the https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/guide/[micronaut-views] module, and this guide provides the Micronaut version of Hotwired's Node example https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-native-demo[which can be found on GitHub].

== Android client

An example Android client can be found https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-android/tree/main/demo[Hotwired's GitHub repository].

In order that it points to your Micronaut version for the backend (instead of the one provided by Hotwire), you will need to https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-android/blob/190607907e814282e97c2d3c3f5fe75ee65c48ba/demo/src/main/kotlin/dev/hotwire/turbo/demo/util/Constants.kt#L3[modify the `BASE_URL` in `Constants.kt`] to point to your Micronaut instance.

NOTE: Ensure the URL does not end with a slash.

You will then be able to run this app locally (or on a real device), and see the results:

== iOS client

An example iOS client can be found https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-ios/tree/main/Demo[Hotwired's GitHub repository].

In order that it points to your Micronaut version for the backend (instead of the one provided by Hotwire), you will need to https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-ios/blob/fadb1f3888427a839f1e102ec5f38125f96172ba/Demo/Demo.swift#L4[modify the `basic` URL in `Demo.swift`] to point to your Micronaut instance.
