=== Testing Health Endpoints

The Micronaut management dependency added for the project supports monitoring your application via endpoints: special URIs that return details about the health and state of your application. Once the `management` dependency is included a `/health` endpoint is exposed.

test:HealthTest[]

callout:micronaut-test[1]
callout:http-client[2]
<3> The health endpoint returns information about the "health" of the application, which is determined by any number of "health indicators".

==== Base Path

The base path for all endpoints is `/` by default. If you prefer the management endpoints to be available under a different base path, configure `endpoints.all.path` as in the following test.

[NOTE]
The leading and trailing `/` are required for `endpoints.all.path`, unless `micronaut.server.context-path` is set, in which case just the leading `/` isn't necessary.

test:HealthPathTest[]

<1> Sets the base path for all management endpoints to `/endpoints/`. This is normally specified in the application configuration (e.g. `application.yml`).
<2> The "health" endpoint is now rooted at `/endpoints/health`
<3> The "health" endpoint is no longer reachable at the default path and results in a "Not Found" status (HTTP 404).

==== Failed Health Status

Disk-space threshold is one of the build-in indicators. This test demonstrates a failed health status when free disk space drops below the specified threshold. The `endpoints.health.disk-space.threshold` configuration property can be provided as a string, like "10MB" or "200KB", or the number of bytes.

test:PoorHealthTest[]

<1> Sets the `endpoints.health.disk-space.threshold` property to an impossibly high value to force a service down status. This is normally specified in the application configuration (e.g. `application.yml`).
<2> A failed heath check results in a Service Unavailable status (HTTP 503)
<3> The response body of the error contains the json string `{"status":"DOWN"}`

You can execute the health endpoint exposed by the application:
