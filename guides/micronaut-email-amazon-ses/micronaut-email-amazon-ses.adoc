=== AWS SES

____
Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) is a cloud-based email-sending service designed to help digital marketers and application developers send marketing, notification, and transactional emails. It is a reliable, cost-effective service for businesses of all sizes that use email to keep in contact with their customers.
____

==== Dependency

Because we added the `email-ses` feature, the application contains the following dependency:

dependency:micronaut-email-ses[groupId=com.micronaut.email]

=== Micronaut AWS SDK v2

Micronaut Amazon SES integration uses https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/guide/#sdkv2[Micronaut AWS SDK v2 integration].
