include::{commondir}/common-header.adoc[]

In this guide, we will write a Micronaut application that exposes some REST endpoints and stores data in a database using JPA and Hibernate.

include::{commondir}/common-requirements.adoc[]

include::{commondir}/common-completesolution.adoc[]

include::{commondir}/common-create-app.adoc[]

=== Data Source configuration

Add the following dependencies:

:dependencies:

dependency:micronaut-hibernate-jpa[groupId=io.micronaut.sql,callout=1]
dependency:micronaut-jdbc-hikari[groupId=io.micronaut.sql,callout=2]
dependency:h2[groupId=com.h2database,scope=runtimeOnly,callout=3]

:dependencies:

<1> Configures Hibernate/JPA EntityManagerFactory beans.
<2> Configures SQL DataSource instances using Hikari Connection Pool.
<3> Add dependency to in-memory H2 Database.

Define the data source in `src/main/resources/application.yml`.

resource:application.yml[tag=datasource]

NOTE: This way of defining the datasource properties means that we can externalize the configuration, for example for
production environment, and also provide a default value for development. If the environment variables are not defined
Micronaut will use the default values. +
Also keep in mind that it is necessary to escape the `:` in the connection URL using backticks ```.

=== JPA configuration

Add the next snippet to `src/main/resources/application.yml` to configure JPA:

resource:application.yml[tag=jpa]

=== Domain

Create the domain entities:

source:domain/Genre[]

The previous domain has a `OneToMany` relationship with the domain `Book`.

source:domain/Book[]

=== Application Configuration

Create an interface to encapsulate the application configuration settings:

source:ApplicationConfiguration[]

In Micronaut, like Spring Boot and Grails, you can create type safe configuration by creating classes that are annotated
with https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#configurationProperties[@ConfigurationProperties].

Create a `ApplicationConfigurationProperties` class:

source:ApplicationConfigurationProperties[]

<1> @ConfigurationProperties` annotation takes a configuration prefix.

You can override `max` if you add to your `src/main/resources/application.yml`:

resource:application.yml[tag=application]

=== Repository Access

To mark the transaction demarcations, we use the https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/transaction/Transactional.html[Java EE 7 javax.transaction.Transactional annotation].

To use it, you have to include the `micronaut-data-processor` dependency in your annotation processor configuration:

dependency:micronaut-data-hibernate-jpa[groupId=io.micronaut.data,scope=annotationProcessor]

Next, create an interface to define the operations to access the database:

source:GenreRepository[]

The implementation:

source:GenreRepositoryImpl[]

<1> Use `javax.inject.Singleton` to designate a class as a singleton.
<2> Inject easily an `EntityManager`.
<3> All database access needs to be wrapped inside a transaction. As the method
only reads data from the database, annotate it with `@ReadOnly`.
<4> This method modifies the database, thus it is annoated with `@Transactional`.

=== Controller

include::{commondir}/common-validation.adoc[]

Create two classes to encapsulate Save and Update operations:

source:GenreSaveCommand[]

<1> Annotate the class with `@Introspected` to generate the Bean Metainformation at compile time.

source:GenreUpdateCommand[]

Create a POJO to encapsulate Sorting and Pagination:

source:SortingAndOrderArguments[]

<1> Use `javax.validation.constraints` Constraints to ensure the incoming data matches your expectations.

Create `GenreController`, a controller which exposes a resource with the common CRUD operations:

source:GenreController[]

<1> It is critical that any blocking I/O operations (such as fetching the data from the database) are offloaded to a separate thread pool that does not block the Event loop.
<2> The class is defined as a controller with the `@Controller` annotation mapped to the path `/genres`.
<3> Constructor injection.
<4> Maps a `GET` request to `/genres/{id}` which attempts to show a genre. This illustrates the use of a URL path variable.
<5> Returning `null` when the genre doesn't exist makes Micronaut to response with 404 (not found).
<6> Maps a `PUT` request to `/genres` which attempts to update a genre.
<7> Add `@Valid` to any method parameter which requires validation. Use a POJO supplied as a JSON payload in the request to populate command.
<8> It is easy to add custom headers to the response.
<9> Maps a `GET` request to `/genres` which returns a list of genres. This mapping illustrates URL parameters being mapped to a single POJO.
<10> Maps a `POST` request to `/genres` which attempts to save a genre.
<11> Maps a `POST` request to `/ex` which generates an exception.
<12> Maps a `DELETE` request to `/genres/{id}` which attempts to remove a genre. This illustrates the use of a URL path variable.

=== Writing Tests

Create a test to verify the CRUD operations:

test:GenreControllerTest[]

<1> Annotate the class with `@MicronautTest` to let Micronaut starts the embedded server and inject the beans. More info: https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-test/latest/guide/index.html[https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-test/latest/guide/index.html].
<2> Inject the `HttpClient` bean in the application context.
<3> Creating HTTP Requests is easy thanks to Micronaut's fluid API.
<4> If you care just about the object in the response use `retrieve`.
<5> Sometimes, receiving just the object is not enough and you need information about the response. In this case, instead of `retrieve` you should use the `exchange` method.

== Using PostgreSQL

When running on production you want to use a real database instead of using H2. Let's explain how to use Postgres.

After installing Docker, execute the following command to run a PostgreSQL container:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -it --rm \
    -p 5432:5432 \
    -e POSTGRES_USER=dbuser \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=theSecretPassword \
    -e POSTGRES_DB=micronaut \
    postgres:11.5-alpine
----

Add PostgreSQL driver dependency:

dependency:postgresql[groupId=org.postgresql,scope=runtimeOnly]

To use PostgreSQL, setup several environment variables which match those defined in `application.yml`:

[source,bash]
----
$ export JDBC_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/micronaut
$ export JDBC_USER=dbuser
$ export JDBC_PASSWORD=theSecretPassword
$ export JDBC_DRIVER=org.postgresql.Driver
----

Run the application again. If you look at the output you can see that the application uses PostgreSQL:

[source, bash]
----
..
...
08:40:02.746 [main] INFO  org.hibernate.dialect.Dialect - HHH000400: Using dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQL10Dialect
....
----

Connect to your PostgreSQL database, and you will see both `genre` and `book` tables.

image::datagrip.png[]

Save one genre, and your `genre` table will now contain an entry.

[source, bash]
----
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8080/genres" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{ "name": "music" }'
----
