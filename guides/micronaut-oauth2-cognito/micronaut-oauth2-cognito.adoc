=== Views

Although the Micronaut framework is primarily designed around message encoding / decoding, there are occasions where it is convenient to render a view on the server side.

To use https://www.thymeleaf.org/[Thymeleaf^] Java template engine to render views in a Micronaut application add the following dependency on your classpath.

dependency:micronaut-views-thymeleaf[groupId=io.micronaut.views]

=== OAuth 2.0

To provide authentication, sign in to your https://aws.amazon.com[AWS^] account and go to https://aws.amazon.com/cognito[AWS Cognito^].

____
With the Amazon Cognito SDK, you just write a few lines of code to enable your users to sign-up and sign-in to your mobile and web apps.

**Standards-based authentication**

Amazon Cognito uses common identity management standards including OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML 2.0.
____

First, create an Amazon Cognito User Pool:

____
**Amazon Cognito User Pools - A directory for all your users**

You can quickly create your own directory to sign up and sign in users, and to store user profiles using Amazon Cognito User Pools. User Pools provide a user interface you can customize to match your application. User Pools also enable easy integration with social identity providers such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon, and enterprise identity providers such as Microsoft Active Directory through SAML.
____

Amazon Cognito Pools are regional. Thus, annotate the region you are using.

While you setup the Amazon Cognito User Pool, you will need to save the pool id:

image::aws-cognito-3.png[]

Configure the appropriate callback, make sure you allow `Authorization code grant` OAuth Flow, and also the scopes `openid` and `email` are selected.

Save the client id and client secret:

To use OAuth 2.0 integration, add the following dependency:

dependency:micronaut-security-oauth2[groupId=io.micronaut.security]

Also add https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/#jwt[Micronaut JWT support^] dependencies:

dependency:micronaut-security-jwt[groupId=io.micronaut.security]

Add the following OAuth2 Configuration:

resource:application.yml[tag=oauth2]

callout:authentication-idtoken[number=1,arg0=Cognito]
callout:oauth2-client-name[number=2,arg0=cognito]
<3> Client ID. See previous screenshot.
<4> Client Secret. See previous screenshot.
<5> `issuer` URL. It allows the Micronaut framework to discover the configuration of the OpenID Connect server. Note: we will use the pool id and region mentioned previously.
<6> Accept GET request to the `/logout` endpoint.

The previous configuration uses several placeholders. You will need to setup `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `COGNITO_REGION` and `COGNITO_POOL_ID` environment variables.

[soruce, bash]
----
export OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=XXXXXXXXXX
export OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=YYYYYYYYYY
export COGNITO_REGION=eu-west-1
export COGNITO_POOL_ID=eu-west-XXCCCAZZZ
----

Although undocumented in the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-userpools-server-contract-reference.html[Amazon Cognito User Pools Auth API Reference^], Cognito provides an https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html[openid-configuration endpoint^] which the Micronaut framework uses to configure your application.

[source, bash]
----
https://cognito-idp.{region}.amazonaws.com/{userPoolId}/.well-known/openid-configuration
----

We want to use an **Authorization Code** grant type flow which it is described in the following diagram:

=== Home

Create a controller to handle the requests to `/`. You will display the email of the authenticated person if any. Annotate the controller endpoint with `@View` since we will use a Thymeleaf template.

source:HomeController[]

callout:controller[number=1,arg0=/]
<2> Annotate with `io.micronaut.security.Secured` to configure secured access. The `SecurityRule.IS_ANONYMOUS` expression will allow access without authentication.
<3> Use https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/api/io/micronaut/views/View.html[View^] annotation to specify which template to use to render the response.
<4> The @api@/io/micronaut/http/annotation/Get.html[@Get^] annotation maps the `index` method to GET `/` requests.

Create a thymeleaf template:

resource:views/home.html[]

Also, note that we return an empty model in the controller. However, we are accessing `security` in the thymeleaf template.

- The https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/api/io/micronaut/views/model/security/SecurityViewModelProcessor.html[SecurityViewModelProcessor]
injects into the model a `security` map with the authenticated user.  See https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/guide/#security-model-enhancement[User in a view^] documentation.

After you execute the native image, navigate to localhost:8080 and authenticate with Cognito.
