== What we are going to achieve in this guide

We are going to create a sample Micronaut application using *Micronaut Data JPA* and *PostgreSQL*.

We will take a look at the common practice of using an https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html[H2] in-memory database for testing and
understand the downsides of this approach. Then we will learn how we can replace this approach
by testing with the same type of database (PostgreSQL in our case) that we use in production
using Testcontainers JDBC URL. Finally, we will look into how we can simplify testing with https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-test-resources/latest/guide/[Micronaut Test Resources].

== Getting Started

common:create-app-features-h2.adoc[]

== Create Entity

First let us start with creating a JPA entity *Product.java*.

source:Product[app=h2]

callout:jpa-table[1]
callout:jpa-entity[2]
callout:jpa-id[3]
callout:jpa-column[4]

== Micronaut Data Repository

Let us create a Micronaut Data `@Repository` interface for the *Product* entity.

source:ProductRepository[app=h2,tags=clazz|close]]

callout:repository[1]
callout:jparepository[2]

== Testing with H2 in-memory database

One of the approaches for testing database repositories is using lightweight databases such as https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html[H2] or https://hsqldb.org[HSQL]
as in-memory databases while using a different database like https://www.postgresql.org[PostgreSQL], https://www.mysql.com[MySQL] or https://www.oracle.com/uk/database[Oracle] in production.

The drawbacks of using a different database for testing are:

* The test database might not support all the features of your production database
* The SQL query syntax might not be compatible with both in-memory database and your production database.
* Testing with a different database than what you use for production will not give you complete confidence in your test suite.

But still, in-memory databases like https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html[H2] are being predominantly used for testing because of their ease of use.

=== Datasource Configuration

To use H2, add the following configuration to define your datasource.

resource:application.properties[app=h2,tag=datasource]

=== H2 Dependency

Add the H2 driver dependency:

dependency:h2[groupId=com.h2database,scope=testRuntimeOnly]

=== Seed Data

We will load the seed data in the tests:

testResource:sql/seed-data.sql[app=h2]

=== ProductRepository Test

Let us see how we can write tests for our *ProductRepository* using https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html[H2].

test:ProductRepositoryTest[app=h2]

callout:seed-db[1]

If you run this test, the application uses the https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html[H2] in-memory database.

The test loads the sample data required for our test, calls the repository method, and asserts the expected result.

But the challenge comes when we want to use features supported only by our production database,
but not by https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html[H2] database.

For example, let us imagine we want to implement a feature where we want to create a new product if a product with a given code does not already exist; otherwise, donâ€™t create a new product.

In PostgreSQL we can implement this using the following query:

[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO products(id, code, name) VALUES(?,?,?) ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
----

But the same query doesn't work with https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html[H2] by default.
When you execute the above query with https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html[H2] then you will get the following exception:

[source,shell]
----
Caused by: org.h2.jdbc.JdbcSQLException: Syntax error in SQL statement "INSERT INTO products (id, code, name) VALUES (?, ?, ?) ON[*] CONFLICT DO NOTHING";"
----

You can run https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html[H2] with PostgreSQL compatibility mode to support PostgreSQL syntax
but still not all the features are supported by https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html[H2].

The inverse scenario is also possible where some query works fine with https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html[H2] but not in PostgreSQL.
For example, https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html[H2] supports the *ROWNUM()* function where PostgreSQL doesn't.
So even if you write tests for repositories using https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html[H2] database there is no guarantee that your code works
in the same way with the production database, and you will need to verify after deploying your application
which defeats the whole purpose of writing automated tests.

Now, let us see how simple it is to replace the https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html[H2] database with a real Postgres database for testing using Testcontainers.

== ProductRepository

Modify the repository to add a method which uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`:

source:ProductRepository[app=postgresql,tags=clazz|methods|close]]

callout:repository[1]
callout:jparepository[2]
callout:at-query[3]

== Testing using Testcontainers

=== PostgreSQL Configuration

Replace the Datasource configuration with the PostgreSQL configuration.

resource:application.properties[app=postgresql,tag=datasource]

We disable schema generation with `jpa.default.properties.hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto=none`. We will use a https://java.testcontainers.org/modules/databases/jdbc/#using-a-classpath-init-script[classpath init script with Testcontainers] instead to load the following SQL file.

testResource:sql/init-db.sql[app=postgresql]

=== PostgreSQL Driver dependency

Remove <<h2-dependency, H2 Dependency>> and add the PostgreSQL driver dependency instead:

dependency:postgresql[groupId=org.postgresql,scope=testRuntimeOnly]

=== Testcontainers Dependencies

Add the Testcontainers dependencies:

dependency:testcontainers[groupId=org.testcontainers,scope=test]

dependency:postgresql[groupId=org.testcontainers,scope=test]

=== Testcontainers JDBC URL

Use https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/databases/jdbc/[Testcontainers *special JDBC URL*] as the data source URL in the test.

test:ProductRepositoryWithJdbcUrlTest[app=postgresql]

callout:micronaut-test-transactional-false[1]
callout:property-driver-class[2]
callout:property-jdbc-url[3]
callout:seed-db[4]

Now if you run the test, you can see in the console logs that our test is using a PostgreSQL database
instead of the https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html[H2] in-memory database. *It is as simple as that!*

Let us understand how this test works.

If we have Testcontainers and the appropriate JDBC driver on the classpath, we can simply use
the special JDBC connection URLs to get a fresh containerized instance of the database each time
the application starts up.

The actual PostgreSQL JDBC URL looks like: *jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres*

To get the special JDBC URL, insert *tc:* after *jdbc:* as follows.
(Note that the hostname, port and database name will be ignored;
so you can leave these as-is or set them to any value.)

[source]
----
jdbc:tc:postgresql:///db
----

We can also indicate which version of PostgreSQL database to use by specifying the Docker image tag after *postgresql* as follows:

[source]
----
jdbc:tc:postgresql:15.2-alpine:///db
----

Here we have appended the tag *15.2-alpine* to *postgresql* so that our test will use a PostgreSQL container
created from *postgres:15.2-alpine* image.

You can also initialize the database using a SQL script by passing *TC_INITSCRIPT* parameter as follows:

[source]
----
jdbc:tc:postgresql:15.2-alpine:///db?TC_INITSCRIPT=sql/init-db.sql
----

Testcontainers will automatically execute the SQL script that was specified using the *TC_INITSCRIPT* parameter.
However, ideally you should be using a proper database migration tool like https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/micronaut-flyway.html[*Flyway*] or https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/micronaut-liquibase.html[*Liquibase*].

The special JDBC URL also works for other databases such as *MySQL*, *PostGIS*, *YugabyteDB*, *CockroachDB* etc.

=== Initializing the database container using Testcontainers and JUnit

If using special JDBC URL doesn't meet your needs, or you need more control over the container creation,
then you can use the JUnit 5 Testcontainers Extension as follows:

test:ProductRepositoryTest[app=postgresql]

callout:micronaut-test-transactional-false[1]
callout:test-containers-disabled-without-docker[2]
callout:test-instance-per-class[3]
callout:seed-db[4]
callout:test-property-provider[5]

We have used the Testcontainers JUnit 5 extension annotations *@Testcontainers* and *@Container*
to start *PostgreSQLContainer* and register the data source properties for the Test using
the dynamic property registration through the *TestPropertyProvider* API.

== Testing with Test Resources

common:test-resources.adoc[]

=== Removing Testcontainers Dependencies

Remove the <<testcontainers-dependencies,Testcontainers dependencies>> from your build files.

=== Configure Test Resources

common:install-test-resources.adoc[]

common:test-resources-postgres.adoc[]

=== Simpler Test with Test Resources

Thanks to Test Resources, we can simplify the test as follows:

test:ProductRepositoryTest[app=postgresqltestresources]

callout:micronaut-test-transactional-false[1]
callout:seed-db[2]

If you run the test, you will see a PostgreSQL container being started by Test Resources through integration with Testcontainers to provide throwaway containers for testing.

common:test-resources-benefits.adoc[]

== Micronaut Data JDBC

https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-data/latest/guide/#jdbc[Micronaut Data JDBC] goes one step further, you have
to specify the dialect in the `JdbcRepository` annotation. Micronaut Data JDBC pre-computes native SQL queries for the specified dialect, providing a repository implementation that is a simple data mapper between a native result set and an entity.

A Micronaut JDBC repository for this sample application would look like:

source:ProductRepository[app=jdbc]

callout:jdbcrepository[1]
callout:crudrepository[2]
callout:at-query[3]

== Summary
We have looked into how to test Micronaut Data JPA repositories using https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html[H2] in-memory database and talked about
the drawbacks of using different (in-memory) databases for testing while using a different type of database
in production.

Then we learned about how simply we can replace https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html[H2] database with a real database for testing using
Testcontainers special JDBC URL. We also looked at using Testcontainers JUnit 5 extension annotations
to spin up the database for testing which gives more control over the lifecycle of the database container.

We learned that Micronaut Test Resources streamlines testing with throwaway containers through its integration with Testcontainers.
