== Micronaut Azure Key Vault Dependencies

Add the following dependency:

:dependencies:

dependency:micronaut-azure-secret-manager[groupId=io.micronaut.azure]

:dependencies:

== Update the Application configuration to use Azure Key Vault secrets

=== Add the Azure Key Vault secret placeholders to the Application Configuration
[,diff]
.src/main/resources/application.properties
----
+ datasources.default.username: ${JDBC-USER}
+ datasources.default.password: ${JDBC-PASSWORD}
----

NOTE: The Azure Key Vault secrets naming convention does not allow "_" to be used as a word joiner. Therefore, when adding JDBC secret placeholders, you should use "-" instead (e.q. JDBC-USER, JDBC-PASSWORD).

common:enable-distributed-configuration.adoc[]

=== Azure Bootstrap Configuration

Add the following configuration for Azure `bootstrap.properties`:

resource:bootstrap.properties[tag=azure]

<1> The client ID of the trusted application that you will register in Azure Portal
<2> The tenant ID
<3> The secret value of the registered application
<4> The Azure Key Vault resource URI

NOTE: More details on how to obtain these values are provided in the Azure Portal section below.

=== Clean up the Application Configuration

Remove the redundant application name entry from the `application.properties`.

== Store JDBC secrets in Azure Key Vault using Azure Portal

Create Azure Key Vault service resource.

When Key Vault service deployment is ready, go to the resource to create secrets. Before clicking on the Secrets option in the left menu list, copy the Vault URI from the main screen section. You will need to set it as an environment variable to integrate Azure Key Vault into your application.

Create new secrets for JDBC user and password. Click on the Secrets option in the left menu, then click on Generate/Import.

Go to App registration to register your application with the Microsoft identity platform. After registering your application,
copy the secret Application (client) ID, and Directory (tenant) ID. You will use them later as environment variables to connect to Azure Key Vault.

Navigate to your application profile to generate application credentials that you will use to authenticate with the Azure Key Vault service. In the left menu, click on the Certificates & secrets. To generate the application credentials, click on the Client secrets tab and then on the New client secret button. Copy the secret value. You must set it along the Application (client) ID, Directory (tenant) ID, and Vault URI as environment variables.

NOTE: The client's secret value cannot be viewed, except immediately after creation. Be sure to save the secret when created before leaving the page

To finish the Key Vault setup process. You will need to assign a proper policy to the Key Vault resource.

* Go to your Key Vault resource profile.
* Click on the Access policies option in the left menu.
* Select Get and List options from the Secret Management Operations list.
* Finally, create an access policy.

Prior to completing the policy creation process, a security principal should be assigned. The policy should refer to your application acting as a security principal.

== Running the Application

With almost everything in place, you can start the application and try it out. First, set environment variables to configure the application datasource, then start the application.

Create environment variables for `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`,  `AZURE_SECRET_VALUE`, and `AZURE_VAULT_URI`, which will be used in the Micronaut app's `application.yml` datasource:

[source,bash]
----
export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<the client id from the Azure configuratipn step>
export AZURE_TENANT_ID=<the tenant id from the Azure configuratipn step>
export AZURE_SECRET_VALUE=<the sercet value from the Azure configuratipn step>
export AZURE_VAULT_URI=<the vault URI from the Azure configuratipn step>
----

You can test the application in a web browser or with cURL.

Run from a terminal window to create a `Genre`:

[source, bash]
----
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8080/genres" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{ "name": "music" }'
----

and run this to list the genres:

[source, bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/genres/list
