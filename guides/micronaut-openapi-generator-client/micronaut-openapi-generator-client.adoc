== Getting Started

https://www.openapis.org[OpenAPI] is a specification for describing REST APIs. Many web APIs provide definitions for the available endpoints and parameters in form of OpenAPI documents. OpenAPI infrastructure includes numerous tooling, including the OpenAPI generator.

In this guide, we will use the Micronaut OpenAPI Generator to generate a client API from an OpenAPI definition file. We will generate the client for link:https://open-meteo.com[Open Meteo], however the steps
could easily be replicated with any other API with an OpenAPI definition.

After generation, we will see how to use the client inside a Micronaut application, including performing API calls in controller methods.

common:completesolution.adoc[]


== Generating the Micronaut Client

We will generate a client for link:https://open-meteo.com[Open Meteo], an open-source weather API which offers free access for non-commercial use.

To do this, we will need to download the official Open Meteo OpenAPI definition file: link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-meteo/open-meteo/main/openapi.yml[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-meteo/open-meteo/main/openapi.yml].

=== Create a Micronaut application

common:cli-or-launch.adoc[]

[source,bash]
----
mn create-app example.micronaut.micronautguide \
   --features=http-client,validation,reactor \
   --build=@build@ --lang=@lang@
----

Open the generated project and create a new folder, `src/openapi` then copy the `openapi.yml` file into it, for example:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd micronaut-guide
$ mkdir src/openapi
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-meteo/open-meteo/main/openapi.yml -o src/openapi/openmeteo.yml
----

=== Configure client generation

:exclude-for-build:maven

Add the Micronaut OpenAPI plugin to your plugins section:

[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
plugins {
  id 'io.micronaut.openapi' version '...'
  ....
}
----

And configure your build to generate a client:

[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
micronaut {
  ...
  openapi {
    client(file("src/openapi/openmeteo.yml")) {
      apiPackageName = "example.openmeteo.api"
      modelPackageName = "example.openmeteo.model"
    }
  }
}
----

The client code will be generated in your build directory but automatically added as a source set.
Therefore, you can for example run `./gradlew compileJava --console=verbose` and see that the sources are generated and compiled:

[source]
----
> Task :generateClientOpenApiApis
...
> Task :generateClientOpenApiModels
...
> Task :compileJava
----

TIP: The Micronaut OpenAPI generator supports a large number of parameters. Please refer to the https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-gradle-plugin/snapshot/#_generating_a_client[Micronaut OpenAPI Gradle plugin documentation] for all possible options.

After generation finishes, you should see the following directory structure under your `build/generated/openapi` directory:

[source,text]
----
build/generated/openapi
├── generateClientOpenApiApis
│   └── src
│       └── main

                            ├── HourlyResponse.java
                            ├── V1ForecastGet200Response.java
                            └── V1ForecastGet400Response.java

<2> The `example.openmeteo.model` package contains data classes, that are used in parameters or bodies of both
requests and responses in the API.

:exclude-for-build:

:exclude-for-build:gradle

Enable the Micronaut OpenAPI client generation in your `pom.xml` file, configure the location to the specification file and package names:

[source, xml]
.pom.xml
----
<properties>
    <micronaut.openapi.generate.client>true</micronaut.openapi.generate.client>
    <micronaut.openapi.definition>src/openapi/openmeteo.yml</micronaut.openapi.definition>
    <micronaut.openapi.api.package.name>example.openmeteo.api</micronaut.openapi.api.package.name>
    <micronaut.openapi.model.package.name>example.openmeteo.model</micronaut.openapi.model.package.name>
</properties>
----

The client code will be generated in your target directory and compiled automatically alongside your regular sources.
Therefore, you can for example run `mvn compile` and see that the sources are generated and compiled:

[source]
----
[INFO] --- micronaut-maven-plugin:4.0.0-M5:generate-openapi-client (default-generate-openapi-client) @ default ---

[INFO] Generating with dryRun=false

TIP: The Micronaut OpenAPI generator supports a large number of parameters. Please refer to https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-maven-plugin/snapshot/examples/openapi.html#generating_a_client[Micronaut OpenAPI Maven plugin documentation] for all possible options.

After generation finishes, you should see the following directory structure under your `target/generated-sources/openapi` directory:

[NOTE]
====
The definition file is a document describing the OpenMeteo API according to the link:https://swagger.io/specification/[OpenAPI Specification].

If you want to learn about the structure of OpenAPI specification and how to simplify the creation of a Micronaut Server
with it, read the link:https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/micronaut-openapi-generator-server.html["Use OpenAPI Definition to Generate a Micronaut Server" guide]
or the link:https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/[OpenAPI guide].
====

As you can see, different API files were generated for the OpenMeteo API.

If you look inside the API files, you will see that method definitions were generated corresponding to different paths and operations available in the API.
Using Micronaut`s features, we will be able to inject a client implementation
of this interface and use it by calling the corresponding methods without the need to worry how client-server communication is handled.

== Testing the Client

You can see that a weather forecast API class was generated in the project.
This API references other types which belong to the model types which were generated automatically from the OpenAPI definition.

We will show how to use the OpenMeteo API by writing a simple test using the generated Micronaut client.

test:WeatherClientTest[tags=test]

<1> Inject the generated client in the test
<2> Calls the client in order to fetch weather forecast
<3> Blocks and consumes the response
