== Getting Started

Let's describe the microservices you will build through the guide.

* `gateway` - A microservice secured via JWT which exposes an endpoint `/user`. The output of that endpoint is the result of consuming the `userecho` endpoint.
* `userecho` - A microservice secured via JWT which exposes an endpoint `/user` which responds with the username of the authenticated user.

The next diagram illustrates the flow:

image::tokenpropagation.svg[]

We generate a valid JWT in the gateway microservice. Then every microservice in our application is able to validate this JWT. We want every internal request to contain a valid JWT token. If we want to talk to another microservice we need to propagate the valid JWT get received.

== Writing the Application

We will write the application first without token propagation. Then we will configure token propagation, and you will see how much code we can remove.

=== Gateway

Create the microservice:

[source,bash]
----
mn @cli-command@ example.micronaut.gateway --build=@build@ --lang=@lang@
----

Add the security-jwt module to the configuration:

:dependencies:

dependency:micronaut-security-annotations[groupId=io.micronaut.security,scope=annotationProcessor]
dependency:micronaut-security-jwt[groupId=io.micronaut.security]

:dependencies:

To keep this guide simple, create a naive AuthenticationProvider to simulate user's authentication.

source:AuthenticationProviderUserPassword[app=intermediate-gateway]

callout:singleton[1]
callout:authentication-provider[2]

Create a class `UserController` which exposes `/user` endpoint.

source:UserController[app=intermediate-gateway]

<1> Annotate with `io.micronaut.http.annotation.Controller` to designate the class as a Micronaut controller.
<2> Constructor dependency injection
<3> Annotate with `io.micronaut.security.Secured` to configure secured access. The `isAuthenticated()` expression will allow access only to authenticated users.
<4> Since we return a string which is not valid JSON, set the media type to `text/plain`.
<5> You can specify the HTTP verb that a controller action responds to. To respond to a GET request, use the `io.micronaut.http.annotation.Get` annotation.
<6> You can bind an HTTP header to a controller method argument.

Create an interface to encapsulate the collaboration with the `userecho` microservice.

source:UsernameFetcher[app=intermediate-gateway]

Create a Micronaut HTTP Declarative client:

source:UserEchoClient[app=intermediate-gateway]

<1> The `@Client` annotation is used with a service id. We will reference the exact service id in the configuration shortly.
callout:requires-not-env-test[2]
<3> Use `@Get` annotation to define the client mapping
<4> Supply the JWT to the HTTP Authorization header value to the `@Client` method.

Add this snippet to `application.yml` to configure the service URL of the `echo` service

resource:application.yml[app=intermediate-gateway,tag=httpservices]

<1> This is the same service ID we used in the `@Client` annotation.
<2> Configure a URL where the `userecho` microservice resides.

Add this snippet to `application.yml` to configure security:

resource:application.yml[app=intermediate-gateway,tag=security]

<1> Set `authentication` to `bearer` to receive a JSON response from the login endpoint.
<2> You can create a SecretSignatureConfiguration named generator via configuration as illustrated above. The generator signature is used to sign the issued JWT claims.
<3> Change this to your own secret and keep it safe (do not store this in your VCS)

==== Tests

Provide a `UsernameFetcher` bean replacement for the Test environment.

test:UserEchoClientReplacement[app=intermediate-gateway]

Create tests to verify the application is secured and we can access it after login:

test:UserControllerTest[app=intermediate-gateway]

callout:micronaut-test[1]
callout:http-client[2]
<3> Test endpoint is secured

=== User echo

Create the microservice:

[source,bash]
----
mn @cli-command@ example.micronaut.userecho --build=@build@ --lang=@lang@
----

Add the security-jwt module to the configuration:

:dependencies:

dependency:micronaut-security-annotations[groupId=io.micronaut.security,scope=annotationProcessor]
dependency:micronaut-security-jwt[groupId=io.micronaut.security]

:dependencies:

Create a class `UserController` which exposes `/user` endpoint.

source:UserController[app=intermediate-userecho]

<1> Annotate with `io.micronaut.http.annotation.Controller` to designate the class as a Micronaut controller.
<2> Annotate with `io.micronaut.security.Secured` to configure secured access. The `isAuthenticated()` expression will allow access only to authenticated users.
<3> Since we return a string which is not valid JSON, set the media type to `text/plain`.
<4> You can specify the HTTP verb that a controller action responds to. To respond to a GET request, use the `io.micronaut.http.annotation.Get` annotation.
<5> If a user is authenticated, the Micronaut framework will bind the user object to an argument of type `java.security.Principal` (if present).

Add this snippet to `application.yml` to change the port where `userecho` starts:

resource:application.yml[app=intermediate-userecho,tag=port]

<1> Configure the port where the application listens.

Add this snippet to `application.yml`

resource:application.yml[app=intermediate-userecho,tag=security]

<1> You can create a `SecretSignatureConfiguration` named `validation` which is able to validate JWT generated by the `gateway` microservice.
<2> Change this to your own secret and keep it safe (do not store this in your VCS)

=== Token Propagation

As you can see, propagating the JWT token to other microservices in our application complicates the code.
We need to capture the `Authorization` header in the controller method arguments and then pass it to the `@Client` bean.
In an application with several controllers and declarative clients, it can lead to a lot of repetition. Fortunately, the Framework includes a feature called token propagation. We can tell our application to propagate the incoming token to a set of outgoing requests.

Let's configure token propagation. We need to modify `application.yml` in the `gateway` microservice:

resource:application.yml[app=gateway,tag=tokenpropagation]

<1> Enable token propagation
<2> We only want to propagate the token to certain services. We can create a regular expression to match those services ids.

We can simplify the code:

Edit `UserController.java` and remove the `@Header` parameter:

source:UserController[app=gateway]

Edit `UsernameFetcher.java` and remove the `@Header` parameter:

source:UsernameFetcher[app=gateway]

Edit `UserEchoClient.java` and remove the `@Header` parameter:

source:UserEchoClient[app=gateway]

Edit `UserEchoClientReplacement.java` and remove the `@Header` parameter:

test:UserEchoClientReplacement[app=gateway]

== Running the App

Run both microservices:

[source,bash]
.userecho

:exclude-for-build:maven
./gradlew run
:exclude-for-build:
:exclude-for-build:gradle
./mvnw mn:run
:exclude-for-build:

[source]

18:29:26.500 [main] INFO  io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut - Startup completed in 671ms. Server Running: http://localhost:8081

[source]

18:28:35.723 [main] INFO  io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut - Startup completed in 707ms. Server Running: http://localhost:8080
----

Send a curl request to authenticate:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8080/login" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{"username": "sherlock", "password": "password"}'
----

[source,json]
----
{"username":"sherlock","access_token":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJzaGVybG9jayIsIm5iZiI6MTYxNTkxMDM3Nywicm9sZXMiOltdLCJpc3MiOiJnYXRld2F5IiwiZXhwIjoxNjE1OTEzOTc3LCJpYXQiOjE2MTU5MTAzNzd9.nWoaNq9YzRzYKDBvDw_QaiUyVyIoc6rHCW_vLfnrtQ8","token_type":"Bearer","expires_in":3600}
----

Now you can call the `/user` endpoint supplying the access token in the Authorization header.

[source,bash]
----
curl "http://localhost:8080/user" -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJzaGVybG9jayIsIm5iZiI6MTYxNTkxMDM3Nywicm9sZXMiOltdLCJpc3MiOiJnYXRld2F5IiwiZXhwIjoxNjE1OTEzOTc3LCJpYXQiOjE2MTU5MTAzNzd9.nWoaNq9YzRzYKDBvDw_QaiUyVyIoc6rHCW_vLfnrtQ8'

After creating the native executables for both microservices, start them and send the same curl requests as before to check that everything works using GraalVM native executables.
