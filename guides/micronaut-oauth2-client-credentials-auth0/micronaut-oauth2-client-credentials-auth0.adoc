== Application Diagram

Download the complete solution of the guideLink:micronaut-microservices-services-discover-consul[Consul and Micronaut Framework - Microservices Service Discovery] guide. You will use the sample app as a starting point. The application contains three microservices:

* `bookcatalogue` - This returns a list of books. It uses a domain consisting of a book name and an ISBN.

* `bookinventory` - This exposes an endpoint to check whether a book has sufficient stock to fulfil an order. It uses a domain consisting of a stock level and an ISBN.

* `bookrecommendation` - This consumes previous services and exposes an endpoint that recommends book names that are in stock.

The `bookcatalogue` service consumes endpoints exposed by the other services. The following image illustrates the original application flow:

image::flow.svg[]

A request to `bookrecommendation` (`http://localhost:8080/books`) triggers several requests through our microservices mesh.

In this guide, you are going to secure the communication between the microservices. You will use a client credentials flow and obtain an access token from an `Auth0` authorization server.

== OAuth 2.0

To provide authentication, sign in to your https://auth0.com[Auth0] account.

=== Create an application

image::auth0-create-application.png[]

=== Obtain client id and client secret

You can obtain the application's domain, client id, and secret in the Auth0 console.

image::auth0-clientid-clientsecret.png[]

=== Obtain API audience

Go to `Applications -> APIs` and copy the API Audience:

image::auth0-applications-apis.png[]

=== Authorize application

In the API Settings, authorize the application in the _Machine to Machine Applications_ tab:

== Writing the application

https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/micronaut-intellij-idea-ide-setup.html[Setup IntelliJ IDEA to develop Micronaut Applications].

=== Dependencies

Modify every application (`bookinventory`, `bookinventory`, and `bookrecommendation`). Add https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/index.html#jwt[Micronaut JWT] and https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/#oauth[Micronaut OAuth 2.0] dependencies:

=== Changes to Book Inventory service

Annotate the Controller's method with `@Secured`:

source:BooksController[app=bookinventory]

callout:secured-is-authenticated[number=1]

To validate the tokens issued by Auth0, configure https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/#jwks[Validation with Remote JKWS]:

common:yaml-dependency.adoc[]

resource:application.yml[app=bookinventory,tag=oauth2]

You can obtain the JWKS URL in the https://micronautguides.eu.auth0.com/.well-known/openid-configuration[`.well-known/openid-configuration`] endpoint.

=== Changes to Book Catalogue service

Annotate the Controller's method with `@Secured`:

source:BooksController[app=bookcatalogue]

callout:secured-is-authenticated[number=1]

To validate the tokens issued by Auth0, configure https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/#jwks[Validation with Remote JKWS]:

resource:application.yml[app=bookcatalogue,tag=oauth2]

You can obtain the JWKS URL in the https://micronautguides.eu.auth0.com/.well-known/openid-configuration[`.well-known/openid-configuration`] endpoint.

=== Changes to Book Recommendations service

==== Books Controller Security

The `GET /books` in the `booksrecommendation` service is open.

Annotate the Controller's method with `@Secured`:

source:BookController[app=bookrecommendation]

callout:secured-anonymous[number=1]

==== Configuration of HTTP Services URLs

Modify `application-dev.yml` to point the declarative HTTP clients to the other microservices URLs.

resource:application-dev.yml[app=bookrecommendation,tag=httpservices]

=== Configuration

Add the following OAuth2 configuration:

resource:application.yml[app=bookrecommendation,tag=oauth2]

<1> OAuth 2.0 client name.
<2> Client id. See previous screenshot.
<3> Client secret. See previous screenshot.
<4> Specify https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/api/index.html[GrantType#CLIENT_CREDENTIALS] `client-credentials` as grant type for this OAuth 2.0 client.
<5> Specify the token endpoint URL. You can obtain the token endpoint URL in the https://micronautguides.eu.auth0.com/.well-known/openid-configuration[`.well-known/openid-configuration`].
<6> Specify https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/api/index.html[AuthenticationMethod#CLIENT_SECRET_POST] as the authentication method. This means the client id and client secret are specified in the body of the HTTP request sent to the token endpoint.
<7> Propagate the access token obtained from Auth0 to requests sent to the services `bookinventory` and `bookcatalogue`. This uses the https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/api/index.html[Micronaut Client Credentials HTTP Client Filter].
<8> https://auth0.com/docs/authorization/flows/call-your-api-using-the-client-credentials-flow[Auth0 requires the API Identifier with an audience key in the token endpoint request] for the client credentials flow.

The previous configuration uses several placeholders with default values. You will need to set up `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `OAUTH_TOKEN_URL` environment variables in your Auth0 application.

[soruce, bash]
----
export OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=XXXXXXXXXX
export OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=YYYYYYYYYY
export OAUTH_TOKEN_URL=https://micronautguides.eu.auth0.com/oauth/token
