== Getting Started

In this guide you will write a Micronaut application with session based authentication.

The following sequence illustrates the authentication flow:

include::{commondir}/common-requirements.adoc[]

include::{commondir}/common-completesolution.adoc[]

== Writing the Application

Create an application using the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#cli[Micronaut Command Line Interface].

`mn create-app example.micronaut.micronautguide --test=spock --lang=@lang@`

The previous command creates a Micronaut application with the default package `example.micronaut` in a directory named `micronautguide`.

include::{commondir}/common-annotationprocessors.adoc[]

=== Security Dependency

Add Micronaut's security dependency to your build file.

Add Micronaut's JWT security dependency.

:dependencies:

dependency:micronaut-security-annotations[groupId=io.micronaut.security,scope=annotationProcessor]
dependency:micronaut-security-session[groupId=io.micronaut.security]

:dependencies:

=== Configuration

Create the next configuration file:

resource:application.yml[tag=security]

<1> Set `micronaut.security.authentication` to `session`. It sets the necessary beans for login and logout using session based authentication.
<2> After the user logs in, redirect them to the Home page.
<3> If the login fails, redirect them to /login/authFailed

=== Authentication Provider

To keep this guide simple, create a naive `AuthenticationProvider` to simulate user's authentication.

source:AuthenticationProviderUserPassword[]

<1> To register a Singleton in Micronaut's application context annotate your class with `javax.inject.Singleton`
<2> A Micronaut's Authentication Provider implements the interface `io.micronaut.security.authentication.AuthenticationProvider`

=== Apache Velocity

By default, Micronaut's controllers produce JSON. Usually, you consume those endpoints with a mobile phone application, or a Javascript front end (Angular, React, Vue.js ...). However, to keep this guide simple we will produce HTML in our controllers.

In order to do that, we use https://velocity.apache.org/[Apache Velocity].
____
Velocity is a Java-based template engine. It permits anyone to use a simple yet powerful template language to reference objects defined in Java code.
____

Add a dependency to Micronaut's https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#views[Server Side View Rendering Module] and to Velocity:

dependency:micronaut-views-velocity[groupId=io.micronaut.views]

Create two velocity templates in `src/main/resources/views`:

resource:views/home.vm[]

resource:views/auth.vm[]

=== Controllers

Create a file named `HomeController` which resolves the base URL `/`:

source:HomeController[]

<1> Annotate with `io.micronaut.security.Secured` to configure security access. Use `isAnonymous()` expression to allow access to authenticated and unauthenticated users.
<2> Annotate with `io.micronaut.http.annotation.Controller` to designate a class as a Micronaut's controller.
<3> You can specify the HTTP verb for which a controller's action responds to. To respond to a GET request, use `io.micronaut.http.annotation.Get`
<4> Use https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/api/io/micronaut/views/View.html[View] annotation to specify which template would you like to render the response against.
<5> If you are authenticated, you can use the `java.security.Principal` as a parameter type. For parameters which maybe null, use `io.micronaut.core.annotation.Nullable`.

== Login Form

Next, create `LoginAuthController` which renders the login form.

source:LoginAuthController[]

<1> Annotate with `io.micronaut.security.Secured` to configure security access. Use `isAnonymous()` expression for anonymous access.
<2> Annotate with `io.micronaut.http.annotation.Controller` to designate a class as a Micronaut's controller.
<3> Responds to GET requests at `/login/auth`
<4> Use https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/api/io/micronaut/views/View.html[View] annotation to specify which template would you like to render the response against.
<5> Responds to GET requests at `/login/authFailed`

== Tests

include::{commondir}/common-geb.adoc[]

Create three pages:

rawTest:HomePage[]

rawTest:LoginPage[]

rawTest:LoginFailedPage[]

Create a test to verify the user authentication flow.

rawTest:SessionAuthenticationSpec[tag=clazz]

<1> Annotate the class with `@MicronautTest` to let Micronaut starts the embedded server and inject the beans. More info: https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-test/latest/guide/index.html[https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-test/latest/guide/index.html].
<2> Inject the `EmbeddedServer` bean.
