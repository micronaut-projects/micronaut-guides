In this guide, you will configure https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)] in a Micronaut application:

____
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resource

== Static Website

In a different folder, create a static website. It makes an HTTP Get Request via Javascript, and it updates an HTML element with the response.

resource:../../../index.html[]

Add a Controller, which the static website consumes via Javascript.

external:hello-base/hellocontroller.adoc[]

common:runapp.adoc[]

== Run the static website

Serve the static website with https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/18/docs/specs/man/jwebserver.html[jwebserver]

____
The jwebserver tool provides a minimal HTTP server, designed to be used for prototyping, testing, and debugging. It serves a single directory hierarchy, and only serves static files. Only HTTP/1.1 is supported; HTTP/2 and HTTPS are not supported.
____

To use `jwebserver`, use Java 18 or greater in a terminal window. You can use https://sdkman.io[SDKMan] to get a list of available Java versions for your computer via `sdk list java`

For example:

[source, bash]
----
% sdk use java 19.0.2-amzn
Using java version 19.0.2-amzn in this shell.
% jwebserver
Binding to loopback by default. For all interfaces use "-b 0.0.0.0" or "-b ::".
Serving ... and subdirectories on 127.0.0.1 port 8000
URL http://127.0.0.1:8000/
----

`jwebserver` serves the UI in port 8000

=== CORS Error

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`, and you will see an error such as:

=== Enable CORS Configuration

Enable https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#cors[CORS configuration]

common:yaml-dependency.adoc[]

resource:application.yml[tag=cors]

Restart the Micronaut application.

Refresh the UI in your browser, and you should see `Hello World` and no errors in the console.

=== Fine-grained CORS Configuration

The previous setup is a "wide open" configuration. It is best to enable CORS access only to a specific list of allowed origins.

You can do that via:

resource:application.yml[tags=cors|corsconfigurations]

You can start the static server in a different port. For example, You could run `jwebserver -p 8001` and verify that it is not allowed. The application's configuration only allows requests with origin `127.0.0.1:8000`
