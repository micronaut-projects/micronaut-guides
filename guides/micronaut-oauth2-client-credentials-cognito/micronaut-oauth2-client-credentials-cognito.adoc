== Application Diagram

Download the complete solution of the guideLink:micronaut-microservices-services-discover-consul[Consul and Micronaut Framework - Microservices Service Discovery] guide. You will use the sample app as a starting point. The application contains three microservices:

* `bookcatalogue` - Returns a list of books. It uses a domain consisting of a book name and an ISBN.

* `bookinventory` - Exposes an endpoint to check whether a book has sufficient stock to fulfill an order. It uses a domain consisting of a stock level and an ISBN.

* `bookrecommendation` - Consumes previous services and exposes an endpoint that recommends book names that are in stock.

The `bookcatalogue` service consumes endpoints exposed by the other services. The following image illustrates the original application flow:

image::flow.svg[]

A request to `bookrecommendation` (`http://localhost:8080/books`) triggers several requests through our microservices mesh.

In this guide, you are going to secure the communication between the microservices. You will use a client credentials flow and obtain an access token from an `Amazon Cognito` authorization server.

== OAuth 2.0

common:cognito.adoc[]

=== Resource server

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-define-resource-servers.html[Define a Resource Server for the User Pool]

image::aws-cognito-resource-server.png[]

In the `App Client Settings`, define `Client Credentials` as the selected OAuth 2.0 flow and check the custom scope you created in the previous step:

== Writing the Application

https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/micronaut-intellij-idea-ide-setup.html[Setup IntelliJ IDEA to develop Micronaut Applications].

=== Dependencies

Modify every application (`bookinventory`, `bookinventory`, and `bookrecommendation`). Add https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/index.html#jwt[Micronaut JWT] and https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/#oauth[Micronaut OAuth 2.0] dependencies:

=== Changes to Book Inventory service

Annotate the Controller's method with `@Secured`:

source:BooksController[app=bookinventory]

callout:secured-is-authenticated[number=1]

To validate the tokens issued by Amazon Cognito, configure https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/#jwks[Validation with Remote JKWS]:

common:yaml-dependency.adoc[]

resource:application.yml[app=bookinventory,tag=oauth2]

You can obtain the JWKS URL in the `\https://cognito-idp.${COGNITO_REGION}.amazonaws.com/${COGNITO_POOL_ID}/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint.

=== Changes to Book Catalogue service

Annotate the Controller's method with `@Secured`:

source:BooksController[app=bookcatalogue]

callout:secured-is-authenticated[number=1]

To validate the tokens issued by Cognito, configure https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/#jwks[Validation with Remote JKWS]:

resource:application.yml[app=bookcatalogue,tag=oauth2]

You can obtain the JWKS URL in the `\https://cognito-idp.${COGNITO_REGION}.amazonaws.com/${COGNITO_POOL_ID}/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint.

=== Changes to Book Recommendations service

==== Books Controller security

The `GET /books` in the `booksrecommendation` service is open.

Annotate the Controller's method with `@Secured`:

source:BookController[app=bookrecommendation]

callout:secured-anonymous[number=1]

==== Configuration of HTTP services URLs

Modify `application-dev.yml` to point the declarative HTTP clients to the other microservices URLs.

resource:application-dev.yml[app=bookrecommendation,tag=httpservices]

=== Configuration

Add the following OAuth2 configuration:

resource:application.yml[app=bookrecommendation,tag=oauth2]

<1> OAuth 2.0 Client name.
<2> Client ID. See previous screenshot.
<3> Client Secret. See previous screenshot.
<4> Specify https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/api/index.html[GrantType#CLIENT_CREDENTIALS] as grant type for this OAuth 2.0 client.
<5> Specify the token endpoint URL. You can obtain the token endpoint URL in the `\https://cognito-idp.${COGNITO_REGION}.amazonaws.com/${COGNITO_POOL_ID}/.well-known/openid-configuration` OpenID auto-configuration endpoint.
<6> Specify https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/api/index.html[AuthenticationMethod#CLIENT_SECRET_BASIC] as the authentication method. This means that basic authentication with client id as username and client secret as password is used for the HTTP request sent to the token endpoint.
<7> Propagate the access token obtained from Amazon Cognito to requests sent to the services `bookinventory` and `bookcatalogue`. This uses the https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/api/index.html[Micronaut Client Credentials HTTP Client Filter].
<8> Request the custom scope that you set in Amazon Cognito Resource Groups.

The previous configuration uses several placeholders with default values. You will need to set up your Amazon Cognito application's `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `OAUTH_TOKEN_URL` environment variables.
