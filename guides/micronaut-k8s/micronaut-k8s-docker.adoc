NOTE: If you want to build a docker Native image with `dockerBuildNative` and you are using https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/[Minikube] make sure that it is configured with enough memory. If you keep getting "Read timeout error" try to build image using `docker build . -t {0} -f DockerfileNative` inside `{0}/build/docker/native-main` directory.
