https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/micronaut-docker-image.html[Build a docker image] of `{0}` service with named `{0}`.

NOTE: if you are using https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/[Minikube] make sure that it is configured with enough memory. If you keep getting "Read timeout error" try to build image using `docker build . -t {0} -f DockerfileNative` inside `{0}/build/docker/native-main` directory.
