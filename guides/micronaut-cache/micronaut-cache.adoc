== Getting Started

In this guide, you will use Micronaut caching annotations to speed up your application.

common:requirements.adoc[]

common:completesolution.adoc[]

common:create-app.adoc[]

=== Configure the Application

In this sample application, we cache news headlines. Add https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-cache/latest/guide/[Micronaut Caffeine Cache] dependency which adds support for cache using https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine[Caffeine].

dependency:micronaut-cache-caffeine[groupId=io.micronaut.cache]

Configure your caches in `application.yml`:

resource:application.yml[tag=config]

<1> Configure a cache called `headlines`.

TIP: Check the https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-cache/latest/guide/configurationreference.html#io.micronaut.cache.caffeine.DefaultCacheConfiguration[properties (`maximum-size`, `expire-after-write` and `expire-after-access`)] to configure the size and expiration of your caches. It is important to keep the caches' size under control.

=== Micronaut Cache API

Imagine a service which retrieves headlines for a given month. This operation may be expensive and you may want to cache it.

source:NewsService[]

callout:singleton[1]
<2> Specifies the cache name `headlines` to store cache operation values in.
<3> Indicates a method is cacheable. The cache name `headlines` specified in `@CacheConfig` is used. Since the method has only one parameter, you don't need to specify the `month` parameters attribute of the annotation.
<4> Emulate an expensive operation by sleeping for several seconds.
<5> The return value is cached with name `headlines` for the supplied `month`. The method invocation is never skipped even if the cache `headlines` for the supplied `month` already exists.
<6> Method invocation causes the invalidation of the cache `headlines` for the supplied `month`.

TIP: If you don't annotate the class with `@CacheConfig`, specify the cache name in the cache annotations. E.g. `@Cacheable(value = "headlines", parameters = {"month"})`

=== Test the Cache

We can verify that the cache works as expected:

test:NewsServiceTest[]

callout:test-method-order[1]
callout:micronaut-test[2]
<3> Inject `NewsService` bean.
callout:timeout[4]
:exclude-for-languages:groovy
callout:order[5]
:exclude-for-languages:

=== Controller

Create a controller which engages the previous service:

source:News[]

callout:serdeable[1]

source:NewsController[]

callout:controller[number=1,arg0=/]

Add a test:

test:NewsControllerTest[]

<1> We call the endpoint twice and verify with the `@Timeout` annotation that the cache is being used.

:exclude-for-languages:groovy

You should be able to execute this curl request and see results:

[source,bash]

curl localhost:8080/NOVEMBER
