== Getting Started

In this guide, you will use Micronaut's caching annotations to speed up your application.

=== Configure the Application

In this sample application, we cache news headlines. Add https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-cache/latest/guide/index.html[Micronaut Caffeine Cache] dependency
which adds support for cache using https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine[Caffeine].

dependency:micronaut-cache-caffeine[groupId=io.micronaut.cache]

Configure your caches in `application.yml`:

resource:application.yml[tag=config]

<1> Configure a cache called `headlines`.

TIP: Check the https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-cache/latest/guide/configurationreference.html#io.micronaut.cache.caffeine.DefaultCacheConfiguration[properties (`maximum-size`, `expire-after-write` and `expire-after-access`)] to configure the size and expiration of your caches. It is important to keep the caches' size under control.

=== Micronaut Cache Api

Imagine a service which retrieves headlines for a given month. This operation may be expensive and you may want to cache it.

source:NewsService[]

<1> To register a Singleton in Micronaut's application context, annotate your class with `javax.inject.Singleton`.
<2> Specifies the cache name `headlines` to store cache operation values in.
<3> Indicates a method is cacheable. The cache name `headlines` specified in `@CacheConfig` is used. Since the method has only one parameter, you don't need to specify the `month` parameters attribute of the annotation.
<4> Emulate an expensive operation by sleeping for several seconds.
<5> The return value is cached with name `headlines` for the supplied `month`. The method invocation is never skipped even if the cache `headlines` for the supplied `month` already exists.
<6> Method invocation causes the invalidation of the cache `headlines` for the supplied `month`.

TIP: If you don't annotate the class with `@CacheConfig`, specify the cache name in the cache annotations. E.g. `@Cacheable(value = "headlines", parameters = {"month"})`

=== Test the Cache

We can verify that the cache works as expected:

test:NewsServiceTest[]

<1> Used to configure the test method execution order for the annotated test class.
<2> Annotation used to define a Micronaut test
<3> Inject `NewsService` bean.
<4> Timeout annotation fails a test if its execution exceeds a given duration. It helps us verify that we are leaveraging the cache.

<5> Used to configure the order in which the test method should executed relative to other tests in the class.

=== Controller

Create a controller which engages the previous service:

source:News[]

source:NewsController[]

Add a test:

test:NewsControllerTest[]

<1> We call the endpoint twice and verify with the `@Timeout` annotation that the cache is being used.

You should be able to execute `curl localhost:8080/NOVEMBER` and see results
