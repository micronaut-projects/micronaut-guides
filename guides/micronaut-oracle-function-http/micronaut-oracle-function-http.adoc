----

common:build-lang-arguments.adoc[]

If you use https://launch.micronaut.io[Micronaut Launch], select "Micronaut Application" as application type, JDK version 11 or higher, and add the `oracle-function`, `oracle-cloud-sdk`, and `graalvm` features.

common:default-package.adoc[]

diffLink:[featureExcludes=oci-java-sdk-core]

https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/micronaut-intellij-idea-ide-setup.html[Setup IntelliJ IDEA to develop Micronaut Applications].

=== Dependencies

Add a dependency for `oci-java-sdk-core` so we have access to classes for managing compute instances:

dependency:oci-java-sdk-core[groupId=com.oracle.oci.sdk]

=== InstanceData

Then create an `InstanceData` DTO class to represent Compute Instance properties:

source:InstanceData[]

=== MicronautguideController

The generated application contains a `MicronautguideController` class which is good for getting started, but we'll update it to demonstrate working with OCI SDK APIs, in this case working with Compute Instances.

Replace the generated `MicronautguideController` with this:

source:MicronautguideController[]

<1> The controller's root URI  is `/compute`
<2> Here we dependency-inject the SDK `ComputeClient` instance
<3> This endpoint accepts `GET` requests and returns current instance properties for the specified instance OCID
<4> This endpoint accepts `POST` requests and starts the specified instance if it is stopped
<5> This endpoint accepts `POST` requests and stops the specified instance if it is running

== Testing the Application

NOTE: The code in this guide should work with recent versions of the Micronaut framework 2.5+, but the tests require at least version 2.5.7

We need to update the generated `MicronautguideControllerTest` to test the changes we made in `MicronautguideController`.

This will be a unit test, so we'll need some mock beans to replace the beans auto-registered by the `oracle-cloud-sdk` module which make requests to Oracle Cloud. We also need to take into consideration the strict class loader isolation used by https://fnproject.io/[Fn Project] (which powers Oracle Cloud Functions).

When running our tests, the test and mock classes are loaded by the regular Micronaut framework classloader, but the function invocations are made in a custom `Fn` classloader, so it is not _directly_ possible to share state between the two, which complicates traditional approaches to mocking. There is support in `Fn` for sharing classes however, so instead of setting values in mock instances from the test to be used by the controller we'll set values in a `MockData` helper class that's registered as a class that's shared between classloaders.

Create the `MockData` class:

test:mock/MockData[]

Next create the `MockAuthenticationDetailsProvider` class. The methods all return `null` since they won't be called; the bean merely needs to exist for dependency injection:

test:mock/MockAuthenticationDetailsProvider[]

<1> The `AuthCachingPolicy` annotation disables caching; without this we would need to provide a valid private key since the provider methods would be invoked when constructing SDK client classes
<2> We use `@Replaces` to replace the previously auto-configuration Oracle Cloud authentication method

Next create the `MockComputeClient` class which will replace the real `ComputeClient` bean:

test:mock/MockComputeClient[]

<1> We use `@Replaces` to replace a previously auto-registered `ComputeClient` bean
<2> The mock class subclasses the real `ComputeClient` class and overrides only the methods used by the controller
<3> The `BasicAuthenticationDetailsProvider` bean (in this case the `MockAuthenticationDetailsProvider` bean created earlier) is dependency-injected because it's needed by the `ComputeClient` constructor

Finally, replace the generated `MicronautguideControllerTest` with this:

test:MicronautguideControllerTest[]

<1> The `MockData` and `LifecycleState` need to be passed to test function invocations as shared classes
<2> Here we set data to be used by the mocks in the `MockData` class
<3> The controller is invoked with the `FnHttpTest` class that, along with `MockFnHttpServer`, provides a bridge between Micronaut controllers and an Fn Project gateway in tests
<4> We expect the String response to be the JSON generated from the `InstanceData` returned by the controller

To run the tests:

:exclude-for-build:maven

[source, bash]
----
./gradlew test

Then open `build/reports/tests/test/index.html` in a browser to see the results.

== Configuring Oracle Cloud Resources

We need to configure some cloud infrastructure to support deploying functions.

Initially, do all the configuration steps described in the guideLink:micronaut-oracle-function[Deploy a Micronaut Function (Serverless) application to Oracle Cloud] guide's "Configuring Oracle Cloud Resources" section since they're the same as for HTTP Gateway functions. To summarize, do the following (unless a resource exists and can be used):

- create a compartment
- create a function user and group
- create an auth token
- configure the OCIR repository in your build script and authenticate to OCIR
- create a VCN and subnet
- create policies

:exclude-for-build:gradle

NOTE: One difference in the configuration steps is that for this guide, do not add a `exec.mainClass` property in `pom.xml` since the property exists in the generated application.

:exclude-for-build:

There is some more infrastructure configuration to do, but we'll need to create the function first.

== Creating the function

First, build the function as a Docker image and push it to the OCIR repository by running:

common:docker-push.adoc[]

Once you've pushed the Docker container, create the function in the console. First, log out from your administrator account and log in as the user created above.

Open the Oracle Cloud Menu and click "Developer Services", and then "Applications" under "Functions":

image::oraclefn/function1.png[]

Click "Create Application":

image::oraclefn/function2.png[]

Choose a name for the application, e.g. `mn-guide-http-function-app`, and select the VCN created earlier. Select the private subnet, and click "Create":

image::oraclefnhttp/function3.png[]

Click "Functions" under "Resources" on the left, and then click "Create Function":

image::oraclefnhttp/function4.png[]

Choose a name for the function, e.g. `mn-guide-http-function`, select the repository where you pushed the Docker image, and select the uploaded image. Select 512MB memory and click "Create":

image::oraclefnhttp/function5.png[]

== Configuring Oracle Cloud Resources (continued)

Like earlier, do all the configuration steps described in the guideLink:micronaut-oracle-function[Deploy a Micronaut Function (Serverless) application to Oracle Cloud] guide's "Enable Tracing and Logs" section since they're the same as for HTTP Gateway functions. To summarize, do the following (unless a resource exists and can be used):

- create an APM domain
- enable logs for your HTTP function
- enable traces for your HTTP function

Next we'll create an API Gateway, plus a few smaller tasks.

=== API Gateway

Create an API gateway by clicking the Oracle Cloud menu and selecting "Developer Services", and then click "Gateways":

image::oraclefnhttp/gateway1.png[]

Click "Create Gateway"

image::oraclefnhttp/gateway2.png[]

then choose a name, e.g. `mn-guide-gateway`, then choose a compartment, VCN, and subnet as before:

image::oraclefnhttp/gateway3.png[]

Click "Deployments", then "Create Deployment":

image::oraclefnhttp/gateway4.png[]

Choose a name for the deployment (e.g. `mn-guide-deployment`), and use the controller's root URI (`/compute`) as the "Path Prefix" value, then click "Next".

image::oraclefnhttp/gateway5.png[]

Enter `/{path*}` as the "Path" value to capture all incoming requests; the Micronaut router will match the incoming path and request method with the proper controller method. Choose `ANY` under "Methods", and `Oracle Functions` as the "Type". Choose `mn-guide-http-function-app` as the "Application" and `mn-guide-http-function` as the "Function Name", then click "Next":

image::oraclefnhttp/gateway6.png[]

Verify that everything looks ok and click "Create":

image::oraclefnhttp/gateway7.png[]

Click the "Copy" link in the "Endpoint" column; this is the base controller URL which will be needed later when testing the function:

image::oraclefnhttp/gateway8.png[]

See the https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/APIGateway/Concepts/apigatewayoverview.htm[API Gateway docs] for more information.

=== Remaining Configuration

==== Ingress Rule

First, add an ingress rule for HTTPS on port 443. Open the Oracle Cloud Menu and click "Networking", then "Virtual Cloud Networks":

image::oraclefn/vcn1.png[]

Click the link for `mn-functions-vcn`:

image::oraclefnhttp/ingress1.png[]

Then click "Security Lists", and click the link for "Default Security List for mn-functions-vcn":

image::oraclefnhttp/ingress2.png[]

Then click "Add Ingress Rules":

image::oraclefnhttp/ingress3.png[]

Enter `0.0.0.0/0` for the source CIDR value, and `433` for the destination port range, and click "Add Ingress Rules":

image::oraclefnhttp/ingress4.png[]

Next we need to grant the function permission to access other cloud resources, in this case compute instances. That will involve creating a dynamic group and adding a new policy statement.

==== Dynamic Group

Create a Dynamic Group by clicking the Oracle Cloud menu and selecting "Identity & Security", and then click "Dynamic Groups":

image::oraclefnhttp/dynamicgroup1.png[]

Click "Create Dynamic Group":

image::oraclefnhttp/dynamicgroup2.png[]

Then enter a name and description for the group, e.g. "mn-guide-dg", and a matching rule, i.e. the logic that will be used to determine group membership. We'll make the rule fairly broad - enter `ALL {resource.type = 'fnfunc', resource.compartment.id = 'ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaxxxxx'}` replacing `ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaxxxxx` with the compartment OCID where you're defining your functions, and click "Create":

image::oraclefnhttp/dynamicgroup3.png[]

See the https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingdynamicgroups.htm[Dynamic Group docs] for more information.

==== Dynamic Group Policy Statement

Next create a policy statement granting members of the dynamic group permission to manage compute instances. Open the Oracle Cloud Menu and click "Identity & Security", and then "Policies":

image::oraclefn/policy1.png[]

Click the link for the Policy you created earlier (i.e. `mn-functions-compartment-policy`):

image::oraclefnhttp/policy2.png[]

Then click "Edit Policy Statements":

image::oraclefnhttp/policy3.png[]

Click "+ Another Statement":

image::oraclefnhttp/policy4.png[]

and enter `Allow dynamic-group mn-guide-dg to manage instances in compartment <compartment-name>`, replacing `<compartment-name>` with the compartment OCID where you're defining your functions, and click "Save Changes":

image::oraclefnhttp/policy5.png[]

== Invoking the function

Since the function works with Compute Instances, make sure you have at least one running. If you don't have any, one easy option is with the guideLink:micronaut-oracle-cloud[Deploy a Micronaut application to Oracle Cloud] guide.

Now is when you need the base controller URL that you copied when creating the API Gateway; it should look something like `\https://cjrgh5e3lfqz....apigateway.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/compute` and end in `/compute` since that's the root URI of the controller.

First, get the status of an instance in a web browser or with cURL by appending `/status/INSTANCE_OCID` to the base controller URL, replacing `INSTANCE_OCID` with the OCID of the Compute Instance to query:

[source, bash]
----
curl -i https://cjrgh5e3lfqz....apigateway.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/compute/status/ocid1.instance.oc1.iad.anuwcljrbnqp5k...
----

and the output should look something like this:

[source, json]
----
{
"availabilityDomain":"nFuS:US-ASHBURN-AD-1",
"compartmentOcid":"ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaarkh3s2wcxbbmqnj...",
"displayName":"dribneb",
"lifecycleState":"RUNNING",
"ocid":"ocid1.instance.oc1.iad.anuwcljrbnqp5k...",
"region":"iad",
"timeCreated":1624594779093
}
----

NOTE: You can also invoke the `/status` action in a web browser since it's a GET method, but the others require cURL or some other application that can make POST requests

The first invocation ("cold start") will take a while as the infrastructure is configured, probably 10-20 seconds or more but subsequent invocations should return in 1-2 seconds.

Next, stop the instance with the same URL, except replace `/status/` with `/stop/`:

[source, bash]
----
curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST https://cjrgh5e3lfqz....apigateway.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/compute/stop/ocid1.instance.oc1.iad.anuwcljrbnqp5k...
----

and the output should look something like this (it should be the same as before except `lifecycleState` should be `STOPPING`):

[source, json]
----
{
"availabilityDomain":"nFuS:US-ASHBURN-AD-1",
"compartmentOcid":"ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaarkh3s2wcxbbmqnj...",
"displayName":"dribneb",
"lifecycleState":"STOPPING",
"ocid":"ocid1.instance.oc1.iad.anuwcljrbnqp5k...",
"region":"iad",
"timeCreated":1624594779093
}
----

Once the status is `STOPPED` you can start it again with the same URL, except replace `/stop/` with `/start/`:

[source, bash]
----
curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST https://cjrgh5e3lfqz....apigateway.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/compute/start/ocid1.instance.oc1.iad.anuwcljrbnqp5k...
----

and the output should look something like this (it should be the same as before except `lifecycleState` should be `STARTING`):

[source, json]
----
{
"availabilityDomain":"nFuS:US-ASHBURN-AD-1",
"compartmentOcid":"ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaarkh3s2wcxbbmqnj...",
"displayName":"dribneb",
"lifecycleState":"STARTING",
"ocid":"ocid1.instance.oc1.iad.anuwcljrbnqp5k...",
"region":"iad",
"timeCreated":1624594779093
}
----

== Deploying as a Native Executable

=== Install GraalVM

common:install-graal-function.adoc[]

=== Building and deploying the native executable

Deploying the function as a native executable is similar to the earlier deployment above.

First you need to update your build script with the location to deploy the native executable Docker container.

:exclude-for-build:maven

Edit `build.gradle` like before, but set the `images` property in the `dockerBuildNative` block this time, replacing `REGION`, `TENANCY`, and `REPO` as before:

[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
dockerBuildNative {
    images = ["[REGION].ocir.io/[TENANCY]/[REPO]/$project.name-native:$project.version"]
}
----

Since it's unlikely that you'll be deploying both jar-based containers and native executable-based containers, you can use the same repo:

[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
dockerBuildNative {
    images = ["[REGION].ocir.io/[TENANCY]/[REPO]/$project.name:$project.version"]
}
----

:exclude-for-build:

:exclude-for-build:gradle

Since it's unlikely that you'll be deploying both jar-based containers and native executable-based containers, you can use the same repo. If you wish to separate the native executable containers, edit `pom.xml` and update the `jib.docker.image` property, appending "-native" to the value:

[source, xml]
.pom.xml
----
<jib.docker.image>[REGION].ocir.io/[TENANCY]/[REPO]/${project.artifactId}-native</jib.docker.image>
----

:exclude-for-build:

Next, update the version.

:exclude-for-build:maven

Edit `build.gradle` and increment the version to `0.2`:

[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
version = "0.2"
----

:exclude-for-build:

:exclude-for-build:gradle

Edit `pom.xml` and increment the version to `0.2`:

[source, xml]
.pom.xml
----
<version>0.2</version>
----

:exclude-for-build:

Depending on the Micronaut version you're using, you might also need to update some properties in your build script to update the Docker configuration.

:exclude-for-build:maven

In your `build.gradle`, change the base image to `gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian10` in the `dockerfileNative` block:

[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
dockerfileNative {
    args("-XX:MaximumHeapSizePercent=80")
    baseImage('gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian10')
}
----

:exclude-for-build:

:exclude-for-build:gradle

In the "configuration" block of the "micronaut-maven-plugin" plugin in your `pom.xml`, change the base image to `gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian10` in a new `baseImageRun` element:

[source, xml]
.pom.xml
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>io.micronaut.build</groupId>
  <artifactId>micronaut-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <baseImageRun>gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian10</baseImageRun>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----

:exclude-for-build:

Then from the demo project directory, run:

common:docker-push-native.adoc[]

Once you've pushed the Docker container, edit the function in the console to use the new container, and to reduce the memory to 128MB:

image::oraclefnhttp/editfunction.png[]

Use the same OCI command as before to invoke the function. No changes are needed because the function OCID doesn't change when deploying new containers.

:exclude-for-languages:

common:next.adoc[]
