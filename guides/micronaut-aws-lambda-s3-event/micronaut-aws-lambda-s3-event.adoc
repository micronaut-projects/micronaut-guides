If you use https://launch.micronaut.io[Micronaut Launch^], select serverless function as application type and add `aws-lambda` feature.

=== Delete Sample Code

The Micronaut framework generates some sample code by default. Delete the following files:

* `src/main/java/example/micronaut/Book.java`
* `src/main/java/example/micronaut/BookRequest.java`
* `src/main/java/example/micronaut/BookSaved.java`
* `src/test/java/example/micronaut/BookRequestHandlerTest.java`

=== Thumbnail Configuration

Add the following configuration:

resource:application.yml[tag=thumbnail]

Create an interface to encapsulate configuration:

source:ThumbnailConfiguration[]

source:ThumbnailConfigurationProperties[]

callout:configuration-properties[1]
callout:configuration-properties-constraints[2]

=== Thumbnail Generation

Create a contract for thumbnail generation. We leverage the `@Pattern` annotation to accept only `jpg` and `png` files.

source:ThumbnailGenerator[]

Add a dependency to https://github.com/coobird/thumbnailator[Thumbnailator^] - a thumbnail generation library for Java.

dependency:thumbnailator[groupId=net.coobird,version=@thumbnailatorVersion@]

Create an implementation of `ThumbnailGenerator` which uses `Thumbnailator`.

source:ThumbnailatorThumbnailGenerator[]

callout:singleton[1]
callout:constructor-di[number=2,arg0=ThumbnailConfiguration]

=== Handler

Add the following dependency to subscribe to `S3NotificationEvent`:

dependency:aws-lambda-java-events[groupId=com.amazonaws,version=@aws-lambda-java-eventsVersion@]

To be able to inject an `S3Client` Add the following dependencies:

:dependencies:

dependency:micronaut-aws-sdk-v2[groupId=io.micronaut.aws]

dependency:s3[groupId=software.amazon.awssdk]

:dependencies:

Create a Handler which receives an S3 notification event and for each S3 event of type `ObjectCreated` creates a thumbnail if the S3 object is a PNG or JPG in the `thumbnails` folder of the same S3 bucket which triggered the event.

source:Handler[]

<1> We want to handle `S3EventNotification` events.
callout:injection[number=2,arg0=S3Client]
callout:injection[number=3,arg0=ThumbnailGenerator]
<4> Extra verification that the event is a `ObjectCreated` event.

== S3

Create an https://aws.amazon.com/s3/[S3^] bucket.

Inside the bucket create two folders `thumbnails` and `images`.

== Lambda

Create a Lambda Function. As a runtime, select Java 11 (Correto).

image::create-function.png[]

=== IAM Role

Grant permissions to access the S3 bucket to the IAM role associated with the Lambda.

=== Triggers

Create two S3 trigger one for PNGs and one for JPGs:

image::s3trigger.png[]

Configure the trigger to:

- Listen only to PUT events.
- Only for files uploaded to the `images` folder
- Only for file suffixed `jpg`

=== Upload Code

include::{commondir}/common-executable-jar.adoc[]

Upload it:

image::upload-function-code.png[]

=== Handler

In the AWS Console, as Handler, set:

`example.micronaut.Handler`

=== Test

You can test it easily; upload a JPG file to the images folder of the S3 bucket you created. You can do this directly in the AWS Console. In a few seconds, you will see a thumbnail saved in the `thumbnails` folder of the bucket.
