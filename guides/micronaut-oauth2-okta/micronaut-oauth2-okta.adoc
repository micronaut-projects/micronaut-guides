=== Views

Although Micronaut is primarily designed around message encoding / decoding, there are occasions where it is convenient to render a view on the server side.

To use https://www.thymeleaf.org/[Thymeleaf] Java template engine to render views in a Micronaut application add the following dependency on your classpath.

dependency:micronaut-views-thymeleaf[groupId=io.micronaut.views]

=== OAuth 2.0

Sign up at https://developer.okta.com[developer.okta.com] and create a Web app with the following characteristics:

- Check `Authorization Code` grant type.
- Add `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback/okta` as a login redirect URIs.
- Add `http://localhost:8080/logout` as a Logout redirect URIs.
- Annotate the Client ID and Secret.

To use OAuth 2.0 integration, add the following dependency:

dependency:micronaut-security-oauth2[groupId=io.micronaut.security]

Also add JWT https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/index.html#jwt[Micronaut JWT support] dependencies:

dependency:micronaut-security-jwt[groupId=io.micronaut.security]

Add the following OAuth2 Configuration:

resource:application.yml[tag=oauth2]

<1> Set `micronaut.security.authentication` as `idtoken`. The idtoken provided by Okta when the OAuth 2.0 Authorization code flow ends will be saved in a cookie. The id token is a signed JWT. For every request, Micronaut extracts the JWT from the Cookie and validates the JWT signature with the remote Json Web Key Set exposed by Okta. JWKS is exposed by the `jws-uri` entry of Okta `.well-known/openid-configuration`
<2> The provider identifier should match the last part of the URL you entered as a redirect URL `/oauth/callback/okta`
<3> Client Secret. See previous screenshot.
<4> Client ID. See previous screenshot.
<5> `issuer` URL. It allows Micronaut to discover the configuration of the OpenID Connect server.
<6> Accept GET request to the `/logout` endpoint.

The previous configuration uses several placeholders. You will need to setup `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `OIDC_ISSUER_DOMAIN` and `OIDC_ISSUER_AUTHSERVERID` environment variables.

[soruce, bash]
----
export OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=XXXXXXXXXX
export OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=YYYYYYYYYY
export OIDC_ISSUER_DOMAIN=https://dev-XXXXX.oktapreview.com
export OIDC_ISSUER_AUTHSERVERID=default
----

Check OKTA https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/oidc#well-knownopenid-configuration[.well-known/openid-configuration documentation].

We want to use an **Authorization Code** grant type flow which it is described in the following diagram:

=== Home

Create a controller to handle the requests to `/`. You are going to display the email of the authenticated person if any. Annotate the controller endpoint with `@View` since we are going to use a Thymeleaf template.

source:HomeController[]

<1> The class is defined as a controller with the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/http/annotation/Controller.html[@Controller] annotation mapped to the path `/`.
<2> Annotate with `io.micronaut.security.Secured` to configure secured access. The `SecurityRule.IS_ANONYMOUS` expression will allow access without authentication.
<3> Use https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/api/io/micronaut/views/View.html[View] annotation to specify which template would you like to render the response against.
<4> The https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/http/annotation/Get.html[@Get] annotation is used to map the `index` method to GET `/` requests.

Create a thymeleaf template:

resource:views/home.html[]

Also, note that we return an empty model in the controller. However, we are accessing `security` in the thymeleaf template.

- The https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/views/model/security/SecurityViewModelProcessor.html[SecurityViewModelProcessor]
injects into the model a `security` map with the authenticated user.  See
https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/guide/index.html#views-security[User in a view] documentation.

After you execute the native image, navigate to localhost:8080 and authenticate with Okta.
