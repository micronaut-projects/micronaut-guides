== Getting Started

In this guide, we will create three microservices and register them with https://www.consul.io[Consul] Service discovery.

____
Consul is a distributed service mesh to connect, secure, and configure services across any runtime platform and public or private cloud
____

You will discover how Micronaut eases Consul integration.

include::{commondir}/common-completesolution.adoc[]

== Writing the App

Let's describe the microservices you will build through the guide.

* `bookcatalogue` - It returns a list of books. It uses a domain consisting of a book name and ISBN.

* `bookinventory` - It exposes an endpoint to check whether a book has sufficient stock to fulfil an order.  It uses a domain consisting of a stock level and ISBN.

* `bookrecommendation` - It consumes previous services and exposes an endpoint which recommends book names which are in stock.

Initially we will hard-code the addresses where the different services are in the `bookcatalogue` service.

image::hardcoded.svg[]

As shown in the previous image, the `bookcatalogue` hardcodes references to its collaborators.

In the second part of this guide we will use a discovery service.

[NOTE]
====
About __registration patterns__

We will use a **self‑registration pattern**. Thus, each service instance is responsible for registering and
deregistering itself with the service registry.
Also, if required, a service instance sends heartbeat requests to prevent its registration from expiring.
====

Services register when they start up:

image::discovery-service-registration.svg[]

We will use **client‑side service discovery**, clients query the service registry,
select an available instance, and make a request.

=== Catalogue Microservice

Create the `bookcatalogue` microservice:

[source,bash]
----
mn create-app example.micronaut.bookcatalogue --build=@build@ --lang=@lang@
----

The previous command creates a directory named `bookcatalogue` and a Micronaut application inside it.

Create a `BooksController` class to handle incoming HTTP requests into the `bookcatalogue` microservice:

source:BooksController[app=bookcatalogue]

<1> The class is defined as a controller with the @api@/io/micronaut/http/annotation/Controller.html[@Controller] annotation mapped to the path `/books`
<2> The `@Get` annotation maps the index method to an HTTP GET request on `/books`.

The previous controller responds a `List<Book>`. Create the `Book` POJO:

source:Book[app=bookcatalogue]

Write a test:

test:BooksControllerTest[app=bookcatalogue]

<1> Annotate the class with `@MicronautTest` to let Micronaut starts the embedded server and inject the beans. More info: https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-test/latest/guide/index.html[https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-test/latest/guide/index.html].
<2> Inject the `HttpClient` bean in the application context.
<3> It is easy to create HTTP requests with a fluid API.
<4> Parse easily JSON into Java objects.

Edit `application.yml`

resource:application.yml[app=bookcatalogue,tag=mn]

<1> Configure the application name. The application name will be use by the discovery service.

include::{commondir}/common-default-dev-environment-application.adoc[]

source:Application[app=bookcatalogue]

include::{commondir}/common-default-dev-environment-application-dev-yaml.adoc[]

resource:application-dev.yml[app=bookcatalogue]

<1> Configure the application to listen on port 8081

Create a file named `application-test.yml` which is used in the test environment:

testResource:application-test.yml[app=bookcatalogue]

Run the unit test:

:exclude-for-build:maven

[source, bash]
----
bookcatalogue $ ./gradlew test
----

:exclude-for-build:

:exclude-for-build:gradle

[source, bash]
----
bookcatalogue $ ./mvnw test
----

:exclude-for-build:

=== Inventory Microservice

Create the `bookinventory` microservice:

[source,bash]
----
mn create-app example.micronaut.bookinventory --build=@build@ --lang=@lang@
----

The previous command creates a directory named `bookinventory` and a Micronaut application inside it.

Create a Controller:

source:BooksController[app=bookinventory]

<1> The class is defined as a controller with the @api@/io/micronaut/http/annotation/Controller.html[@Controller] annotation mapped to the path `/books`
<2> By default, `Content-Type` of Micronaut's response is `application/json` : override this with `text/plain` since we are returning a String, not a JSON object.
<3> The `@Get` annotation maps the index method to an HTTP GET request on `/books/stock/{isbn}`.

Create the POJO used by the controller:

source:BookInventory[app=bookinventory]

Write a test:

test:BooksControllerTest[app=bookinventory]

Edit `application.yml`

resource:application.yml[app=bookinventory,tag=mn]

<1> Configure the application name. The name will be used later in the guide.

include::{commondir}/common-default-dev-environment-application.adoc[]

source:Application[app=bookinventory]

include::{commondir}/common-default-dev-environment-application-dev-yaml.adoc[]

resource:application-dev.yml[app=bookinventory]

<1> Configure the application to listen on port 8082

Create a file named `application-test.yml` which is used in the test environment:

testResource:application-test.yml[app=bookinventory]

Run the unit test:

:exclude-for-build:maven

[source, bash]
----
bookinventory $ ./gradlew test
----

:exclude-for-build:

:exclude-for-build:gradle

[source, bash]
----
bookinventory $ ./mvnw test
----

:exclude-for-build:

=== Recommendation Microservice

Create the `bookrecommendation` microservice:

[source,bash]
----
mn create-app example.micronaut.bookrecommendation --build=@build@ --lang=@lang@
----

The previous command creates a directory named `bookrecommendation` and a Micronaut application inside it.

Create an interface to map operations with `bookcatalogue`, and a Micronaut Declarative HTTP Client to consume it.

source:BookCatalogueOperations[app=bookrecommendation]

source:BookCatalogueClient[app=bookrecommendation,tags=packageandimports|harcoded|clazz]

<1> Use `@Client` to use https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#clientAnnotation[declarative HTTP Clients]

The client returns a POJO. Create it in the `bookrecommendation`:

source:Book[app=bookrecommendation]

Create an interface to map operations with `bookinventory`, and a Micronaut Declarative HTTP Client to consume it.

source:BookInventoryOperations[app=bookrecommendation]

source:BookCatalogueClient[app=bookrecommendation,tags=packageandimports|harcoded|clazz]

<1> Use `@Client` to use https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#clientAnnotation[declarative HTTP Clients]

Create a Controller which injects both clients.

source:BookController[app=bookrecommendation]

<1> The class is defined as a controller with the @api@/io/micronaut/http/annotation/Controller.html[@Controller] annotation mapped to the path `/books`
<2> Clients are injected via constructor injection
<3> The `@Get` annotation maps the index method to an HTTP GET request on `/books`.

The previous controller returns a `Publisher<BookRecommendation>`. Create the `BookRecommendation` POJO:

source:BookRecommendation[app=bookrecommendation]

`BookCatalogueClient` and `BookInventoryClient` will fail to consume the `bookcatalogue` and `bookinventory` during the tests phase.

Using the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#clientFallback[@Fallback] annotation you can declare a fallback implementation of a client that will be picked up and used once all possible retries have been exhausted

Create `@Fallback` alternatives in the `test` classpath.

test:BookInventoryClientStub[app=bookrecommendation]

<1> Make this fallback class to be effective only when the Micronaut environment __TEST__ is active
<2> Here we arbitrarily decided that if everything else fails, that book's `stock` would be true
<3> Similarly, we decided that other book's `stock` method would be false
<4> Finally, any other book will have their `stock` method return an empty value

test:BookCatalogueClientStub[app=bookrecommendation]

Write a test:

test:BookControllerTest[app=bookrecommendation]

Edit `application.yml`

resource:application.yml[app=bookrecommendation,tag=mn]

<1> Configure the application name. The name will be used later in the guide.

include::{commondir}/common-default-dev-environment-application.adoc[]

source:Application[app=bookrecommendation]

include::{commondir}/common-default-dev-environment-application-dev-yaml.adoc[]

resource:application-dev.yml[app=bookrecommendation]

<1> Configure the application to listen on port 8080

Create a file named `application-test.yml` which is used in the test environment:

testResource:application-test.yml[app=bookrecommendation]

Run the unit test:

:exclude-for-build:maven

[source, bash]
----
bookinventory $ ./gradlew test
----

:exclude-for-build:

:exclude-for-build:gradle

[source, bash]
----
bookinventory $ ./mvnw test

== Consul and Micronaut

=== Install Consul via Docker

The quickest way to start using https://hub.docker.com/_/consul/[Consul is via Docker]:

[source,bash]
----
$ docker run -p 8500:8500 consul
----

Alternatively you can https://www.consul.io/docs/install/index.html[install and run a local Consul instance].

The following screenshots show how to install/run Consul via https://kitematic.com[Kitematic]; graphical user interface for Docker.

Configure ports:

image::kitematic-consul-2.png[]

=== Book Catalogue

Modify your build file to add the `discovery-client` feature.

dependency:micronaut-discovery-client[groupId=io.micronaut.discovery]

Append to `bookcatalogue` service `application.yml` the following snippet:

resource:application.yml[app=bookcatalogue,tag=consul]

This configuration registers a Micronaut application with Consul with minimal configuration. Discover a more complete list of configuration options at https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-discovery-client/latest/api/io/micronaut/discovery/consul/ConsulConfiguration.html[ConsulConfiguration].

Disable consul registration in tests:

testResource:application-test.yml[app=bookcatalogue,tag=consul]

=== Book Inventory

Modify your build file to add the `discovery-client` feature.

dependency:micronaut-discovery-client[groupId=io.micronaut.discovery]

Also, modify the `application.yml` of the `bookinventory` application with the following snippet:

resource:application.yml[app=bookinventory,tag=consul]

Disable consul registration in tests:

testResource:application-test.yml[app=bookinventory,tag=consul]

=== Book Recommendation

Modify your build file to add the `discovery-client` feature.

dependency:micronaut-discovery-client[groupId=io.micronaut.discovery]

Also, append to `bookrecommendation`.`application.yml` the following snippet:

resource:application.yml[app=bookrecommendation,tag=consul]

Modify `BookInventoryClient` and `BookCatalogueClient` to use the service id instead of a harcoded ip.

source:BookCatalogueClient[app=bookrecommendation,tags=packageandimports|consul|clazz]

<1> Use the configuration value `micronaut.application.name` used in `bookcatalogue` as service `id`.

source:BookInventoryClient[app=bookrecommendation,tags=packageandimports|consul|clazz]

<1> Use the configuration value `micronaut.application.name` used in `bookinventory` as service `id`.

Disable consul registration in tests:

testResource:application-test.yml[app=bookrecommendation,tag=consul]

=== Running the App

Run `bookcatalogue` microservice:

[source,bash]
----
bookcatalogue $ ./gradlew run
...
14:28:34.034 [main] INFO  io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut - Startup completed in 499ms. Server Running: http://localhost:8081
