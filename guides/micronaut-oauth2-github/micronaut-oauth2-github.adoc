=== Views

Although the Micronaut framework is primarily designed around message encoding / decoding, there are occasions where it is convenient to render a view on the server side.

We'll use the https://www.thymeleaf.org/[Thymeleaf] Java template engine to render views.

=== Home

Create a controller to handle the requests to `/`. You will display the email of the authenticated person if any. Annotate the controller endpoint with `@View` since we will use a Thymeleaf template.

source:HomeController[]

callout:controller[number=1,arg0=/]
callout:secured-anonymous[number=2]
<3> Use https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/api/io/micronaut/views/View.html[View] annotation to specify which template to use to render the response.
<4> The @api@/io/micronaut/http/annotation/Get.html[@Get] annotation maps the `index` method to GET `/` requests.

Create a Thymeleaf template:

resource:views/home.html[]

Also, note that we return an empty model in the controller. However, we are accessing `security` in the Thymeleaf template.

- The https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/api/io/micronaut/views/model/security/SecurityViewModelProcessor.html[SecurityViewModelProcessor]
injects into the model a `security` map with the authenticated user.  See
https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/guide/#security-model-enhancement[User in a view] documentation.

=== GitHub OAuth App

To provide authentication, create a https://developer.github.com/apps/about-apps/[GitHub OAuth App].

=== OAuth 2.0 Configuration

Add the following OAuth2 Configuration:

common:yaml-dependency.adoc[]

resource:application.yml[tag=oauth2]

<1> Once validated, we will save the ID Token in a Cookie. To read in subsequent requests, set `micronaut.security.authentication` to `cookie`.
<2> You can create a https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/api/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/signature/secret/SecretSignatureConfiguration.html[SecretSignatureConfiguration] named `generator` via configuration as illustrated above. The `generator` signature is used to sign the issued JWT claims.
<3> Change this to your own secret and keep it safe (do not store this in your VCS).
callout:oauth2-client-name[number=4,arg0=github]
<5> Client Secret. See previous screenshot.
<6> Client ID. See previous screenshot.
<7> Specify the scopes you want to request. https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/[GitHub Scopes] let you sepcify exactly what type of access you need.
<8> Map manually the GitHub https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.1[Authorization endpoint].
<9> Map manually the Github https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.2[Token endpoint].
<10> Accept GET request to the `/logout` endpoint.

The previous configuration uses several placeholders. You will need to set up `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables.

[soruce, bash]
----
export OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=XXXXXXXXXX
export OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=YYYYYYYYYY

=== User Details Mapper

Here is a high level diagram of how the authorization code grant flow works with an OAuth 2.0 provider such as GitHub.

We need an HTTP Client to retrieve the user info. Create a POJO to represent a GitHub user:

source:GithubUser[]

Then, create a Micronaut Declarative HTTP Client to consume https://developer.github.com/v3/[GitHub REST API v3]

source:GithubApiClient[tag=clazz]

<1> GitHub encourages explicitly requesting version 3 via the Accept header. With `@Header`, you add the `Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json` HTTP header to every request.
<2> Add the id `githubv3` to the `@Client` annotation. Later, you will provide URL for this client id.
<3> Define a HTTP GET request to `/user` endpoint.
<4> You can return reactive types in a Micronaut declarative HTTP client.
<5> You can specify that a parameter binds to a HTTP Header such as the *Authorization* header.

Specify the URL for the `githubv3` service.

resource:application.yml[tag=micronaut-http-services]

For GitHub we need to provide a Authentication Mapper. The easiest way is to create a bean which implements `OauthAuthenticationMapper`.

source:GithubAuthenticationMapper[]

<1> Usa a name qualifier for the bean which matches the name you used in the OAuth 2.0 configuration in `application.yml`
<2> Consume the `/user` endpoint with the Micronaut HTTP Client.
<3> Save the original GitHub access token in a claim. We will use it to contact GitHub's API later.

=== Retrieve User GitHub repositories

With the access token, we retrieved during the login we will contact the GitHub API to fetch the user's repositories.

First, create a POJO to represent a GitHub repository:

source:GithubRepo[]

Add a method to `GithubApiClient`

source:GithubApiClient[tag=repos]

<1> Specify two query values `sort` and `direction`.
<2> Annotate `sort` and `direction` as `@Nullable` since they are optional. You can restrict the allowed values with use of constraints.

Create a controller to expose `/repos` endpoint:

source:ReposController[]

<1> Qualify the `@Controller` annotation with `/repos` to designate the endpoint URL.
<2> We want this endpoint to be only accessible to authenticated users.
<3> We specify the view name `repos` which renders the model.
<4> Declare a GET endpoint.
<5> Consume the GitHub API.
<6> Use the previously obtained access token to get access against the GitHub API.

Create a Thymeleaf template:

resource:views/repos.html[]
