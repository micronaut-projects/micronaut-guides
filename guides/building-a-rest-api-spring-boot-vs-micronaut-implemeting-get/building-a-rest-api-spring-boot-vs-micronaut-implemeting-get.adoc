== Introduction

This guide compares how to test implement a GET in a Micronaut Framework and Spring Boot applications.

This guide is the second tutorial of https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/tag-building_a_rest_api.html[Building a Rest API] - a series of tutorials comparing how to develop a REST API with Micronaut Framework and Spring Boot.

== Controller

To implement a GET `/subscriptions/{id}` endpoint, you need to create a controller in both frameworks.

The API is quite similar:

.Comparison between Spring Boot and Micronaut Framework
|===
| | Spring Boot | Micronaut

| Mark a bean as a controller
| Annotate with `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping`
| Annotate with `@Controller`

| Identify a method as a GET endpoint
| Annotate with `@GetMapping`
| Annotate with `@Get`

| Identify a method parameter as a path variable
| Annotate with Spring's `@PathVariable`
| Annotate with Micronaut's `@PathVariable`

| Respond HTTP Responses with a status code and a body
| Return a `ResponseEntity`
| Return an `HttpResponse`
|===

NOTE: Another important difference is the controller's method visibility. **Micronaut Framework does not use reflection (which leads to better performance and better integration with technologies such as GraalVM)**. Thus, it requires the controller's methods to be public, protected, or package-private (no modifier). Throughout these tutorials, Micronaut controllers' methods use package-private.

=== Spring Boot Controller

This is the Spring Boot controller:

source:SaasSubscriptionController[app=springboot]

callout:spring-boot-rest-controller[1]
callout:spring-boot-request-mapping[2]
callout:spring-boot-get-mapping[number=3,arg0=findById,arg1=/subscriptions/{id}]
callout:spring-boot-path-variable[number=4]

=== Micronaut Controller

This is the Micronaut controller:

source:SaasSubscriptionController[app=micronautframework]

callout:controller[number=1,arg0=/subscriptions]
callout:get[number=2,arg0=findById,arg1=/subscriptions/{id}]
callout:pathvariable[3]
callout:http-response[4]

==== Without HTTPResponse

NOTE: The default HTTP Status code in a Micronaut controller method is 200. However, when a Micronaut controller's method returns null, the application responds with a 404 status code.

Thus, you could simplify the previous controller as:

source:SaasSubscriptionController[app=micronautframeworkjacksondatabind]

callout:controller[number=1,arg0=/subscriptions]
callout:get[number=2,arg0=findById,arg1=/]
callout:pathvariable[3]
callout:returning-null[4]

=== Route Compile-Time Validation

common:route-compile-time-validation.adoc[]

For example, if you replace the `@Get("/{id}")` annotation with `@Get("/{identifier}")`, the application fails to compile.

== Tests

common:assertj-and-json-path.adoc[]

=== Spring Boot Test

We could write a test in Spring Boot using https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/test/web/client/TestRestTemplate.html[`TestRestTemplate`].

test:SaasSubscriptionControllerGetTest[app=springboot]

callout:spring-boot-test[1]
callout:autowired[number=2,arg0=TestRestTemplate]
callout:spring-boot-test-rest-template[number=3]

=== Micronaut Test

The main difference with the Spring Boot Test, is that we use the https://docs.micronaut.io/4.4.6/guide/#httpClient[Micronaut HTTP Client] to test the embedded server.

test:SaasSubscriptionControllerGetTest[app=micronautframework]

callout:micronaut-test[1]
callout:http-client[2]
callout:http-client-response-exception[3]

== Conclusion

Defining routes is extremely similar in both frameworks. However, Micronaut Framework provides compile-time validation of routes and a reflection-free approach to do it.
