NOTE: The HTTP client could have used the `ETag` from the upload operation and send it in a `If-None-Match` header in the
download request https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag#caching_of_unchanged_resources[to implement caching],
which then would have been to be implemented in the download endpoint. But this is beyond the scope of this guide.
