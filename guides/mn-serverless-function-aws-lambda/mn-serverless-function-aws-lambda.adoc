Please read about https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/guide/#lambda[Micronaut AWS Lambda Support] to learn more about different Lambda runtime, Triggers, and Handlers, and how to integrate with a Micronaut application.

If you want to respond to triggers such as queue events, S3 events, or single endpoints, you should opt to code your Micronaut functions as Serverless functions.

In this guide, we will deploy a Micronaut serverless function to AWS Lambda.

== Writing the Application

include::{commondir}/common-cli-or-launch.adoc[]

[source,bash]
----
mn create-function-app example.micronaut.micronautguide --features=aws-lambda --build=@build@ --lang=@lang@
----

include::{commondir}/common-build-lang-arguments.adoc[]

If you use https://launch.micronaut.io[Micronaut Launch], select serverless function as application type and add the `aws-lambda` feature.

include::{commondir}/common-default-package.adoc[]

include::{commondir}/common-annotationprocessors.adoc[]

We want to support a JavaBean as input and output types.

The input is a  `Book` object:

source:Book[]

* Annotate the class with `@Introspected` to generate the Bean Metainformation at compile time.

The output is a `BookSaved` object:

source:BookSaved[]

* Annotate the class with `@Introspected` to generate the Bean Metainformation at compile time.

The application contains a class extending https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/api/io/micronaut/function/aws/MicronautRequestHandler.html[MicronautRequestHandler]

source:BookRequestHandler[]

* The class extends https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/api/io/micronaut/function/aws/MicronautRequestHandler.html[MicronautRequestHandler] and defines input and output types.

The generated test shows how to verify the function behaviour:

test:BookRequestHandlerTest[]

* When you instantiate the Handler, the application context starts.
* Remember to close your application context when you end your test. You can use your handler to obtain it.
* Invoke the `execute` method of the handler.

== Lambda

Create a Lambda Function. As a runtime, select Java 11 (Correto).

=== Upload Code

include::{commondir}/common-executable-jar.adoc[]

Upload it:

=== Handler

As Handler, set:

`example.micronaut.BookRequestHandler`

=== Test

You can test it easily.
