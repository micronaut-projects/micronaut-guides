common:header.adoc[]

You are going to use https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/language/records.html[Record Classes] in a Micronaut application.

____
Record classes, which are a special kind of class, help to model plain data aggregates with less ceremony than normal classes.

A record declaration specifies in a header a description of its contents; the appropriate accessors, constructor, equals, hashCode, and toString methods are created automatically. A record's fields are final because the class is intended to serve as a simple "data carrier."

NOTE: If you use https://launch.micronaut.io[Micronaut Launch], select "Micronaut Application" as application type and add `postgres`, `data-jdbc`, and `liquibase` as features.

=== Immutable Configuration with Java Records

source:ValueAddedTaxConfiguration[]

callout:configuration-properties[1]

Write a test:

test:ValueAddedTaxConfigurationTest[]

callout:property[1]
callout:micronaut-test-start-application-false[2]

=== Database Migration with Liquibase

We need a way to create the database schema. For that, we use
https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-liquibase/latest/guide/[Micronaut integration with Liquibase].

Add the following snippet to include the necessary dependencies:

dependency:micronaut-liquibase[groupId=io.micronaut.liquibase]

Configure the database migrations directory for http://www.liquibase.org[Liquibase] in `application.yml`.

resource:application.yml[tag=liquibase]

Create the following files with the database schema creation and a book:

resource:db/liquibase-changelog.xml[]

resource:db/changelog/01-create-books-schema.xml[]

resource:db/changelog/02-insert-book.xml[]

During application startup, http://www.liquibase.org[Liquibase] executes the SQL file, creates the schema needed for the application and inserts one book.

=== Mapped Entities with Java Records

Create a Micronaut Data Mapped Entity

source:Book[]

callout:mapped-entity[1]
<2> The primary key is annotated with `@Id`. It is an assigned primary key.
callout:constraints[3]
<4> Annotate `about` with `@Nullable`, since it is optional.

=== Projections with Java Records

Create a record to project some data from the `book` table. For example, exclude the `about` field.

source:BookCard[]

callout:serdeable[1]
callout:constraints[2]

Create a https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-data/latest/guide/#dbcRepositories[Repository], which uses the previous Java record as a DTO projection.

source:BookRepository[]

callout:jdbcrepository[1]
callout:crudrepository[2]
callout:dto-projection[3]

=== JSON serialization with Java Records

Create a Java record to represent a JSON response:

source:BookForSale[]

callout:serdeable[1]
<2> Jackson requires reflection to use Records. With `@ReflectiveAccess` the Micronaut framework will add the class to the GraalVM `reflect-config.json` file.
callout:constraints[3]

Create a Controller that uses the previous record:

source:BookController[]

callout:controller[number=1,arg0=/books]
callout:constructor-di[number=2,arg0=BookRepository]
callout:executes-on[3]
callout:get[number=4,arg0=index,arg1='/']
<5> Respond a Java Record and the application responds JSON representation of the object

=== Create a Test

Create a test:

test:BookControllerTest[]

callout:property[1]
callout:micronaut-test-transactional-false[2]
callout:http-client[3]
<4> Multiline string
callout:binding-json-array[5]

common:test-resources-postgres.adoc[]

== Datasource configuration

Although the URL is configured automatically via <<Test Resources>>, we must configure the PostgreSQL driver and dialect in `application.yml`:

resource:application.yml[tag=datasource]

<1> Use PostgreSQL driver.
<2> Configure the PostgreSQL dialect.
<3> You handle database migrations via Liquibase

common:testApp.adoc[]

== Running the application

Set up the environment variable to configure the VAT percentage.

Configure
[source,bash]
----
export VAT_PERCENTAGE=20
----

common:runapp-instructions.adoc[]

You can run a cURL command to test the application:

[source, bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/books
----

[source,json]
----
[{"isbn":"0321601912","title":"Continuous Delivery","price":47.99}]
----

common:graal-with-plugins.adoc[]

WARNING: Due to a https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/3984[bug with GraalVM and Java Records] it is necessary to include the flag `--report-unsupported-elements-at-runtime` when building the native executable. Create the file `native-image.properties`:

resource:META-INF/native-image/example.micronaut/guide/native-image.properties[]

You can run a cURL command to test the application:

[source, bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/books
----

[source,json]
----
[{"isbn":"0321601912","title":"Continuous Delivery","price":47.99}]
----

You receive an empty array because there are no books in the database. You can create a Liquibase changelog to add seed data.
