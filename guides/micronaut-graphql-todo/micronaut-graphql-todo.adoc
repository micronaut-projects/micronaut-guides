== Getting Started

In this guide, you will create a Micronaut application written in @language@ that uses https://graphql.org/[GraphQL] to create a todo application.

____
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides
a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they
need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.
____

You will be using:

* A PostgreSQL instance running in Docker.
* https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-data/latest/guide/[Micronaut Data] to persist our ToDos to this database.
* https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-flyway/latest/guide/[Flyway] to handle our database migrations.
* https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-graphql/latest/guide/[Micronaut GraphQL] to expose our data.
* Testcontainers to run a PostgreSQL instance for local dev, and tests.

The application will expose a GraphQL endpoint at `/graphql` for the data to be consumed and modified.

== Persistence layer

common:flyway.adoc[]

resource:db/migration/V1__schema.sql[]

<1> Authors will be stored in table separate to the ToDos.  They just have a username.
<2> ToDos have a title, completion status, and a foreign-key reference to the author.

=== Entities

Create an Entity class to represent an Author:

source:Author[]

callout:mapped-entity[1]
callout:mapped-entity-id[2]

And another to represent a ToDo:

source:ToDo[]

callout:mapped-entity[1]
callout:mapped-entity-id[2]

=== Repositories

Create a https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-data/latest/guide/#dbcRepositories[`JdbcRepository`] for each of our Entity classes.

The simplest of these is the `ToDoRepository` which just requires the default methods:

source:ToDoRepository[]

callout:jdbcrepository[1]
callout:crudrepository[2]

Then create a Repository for the Authors.  This requires extra finders for this to simplify the GraphQL wiring in the next step:

source:AuthorRepository[]

callout:jdbcrepository[1]
callout:crudrepository[2]
<3> When creating todos a method is required to search for an exisiting username.
<4> When GraphQL loads a ToDo, it use this to fetch the authors if they are required in the response.
<5> Find an existing author, or else create a new one when creating a ToDo.

== GraphQL

The initial Micronaut application `create-app` step already added the GraphQL dependency:

dependency:micronaut-graphql[groupId=io.micronaut.graphql]

So the default GraphQL endpoint `/graphql` is enabled, and extra configuration is not required.

=== Describe your schema

Create the file `schema.graphqls`:

resource:schema.graphqls[]

<1> Declare a `toDos` query function to fetch all the todos as a list.
<2> Declare a `createToDo` mutation function to create and return a new ToDo.
<3> Declare a `completeToDo` mutation function to mark a ToDo as done (and return a boolean indicating success).
<4> Declare a `ToDo` type.
<5> Declare an `Author` type.

=== Data Fetchers

For each query and mutator in the schema, create a `DataFetcher` which will bind the GraphQL schema to our domain model.
These will execute the appropriate queries in the datastore.

==== Queries

Create class `ToDosDataFetcher` to implement the `toDos` query:

source:ToDosDataFetcher[]

callout:singleton[1]
callout:constructor-di[number=2,arg0=ToDoRepository]

==== Mutations

Create `CreateToDoDataFetcher` for the creation of ToDos:

source:CreateToDoDataFetcher[]

callout:singleton[1]
callout:constructor-di[number=2,arg0=ToDoRepository]
<3> Find the existing author or create a new one.
<4> Persist the new ToDo.

And `CompleteToDoDataFetcher` to mark ToDos as complete:

source:CompleteToDoDataFetcher[]

callout:singleton[1]
callout:constructor-di[number=2,arg0=ToDoRepository]
<3> Find the existing ToDo based on its id.
<4> If found, set completed.
<5> And update the version in the database.

==== Wiring

GraphQL allows data to be fetched on demand.
In this example, a user may request a list of ToDos, but not require the author to be populated.
A method is required to optionally load Authors based on their ID.

To do this, register a DataLoader that finds authors based on a collection of ids:

source:AuthorDataLoader[]

callout:singleton[1]
callout:io-executor-service[2]

This is registered in the DataLoaderRegistry under the key `author`

source:DataLoaderRegistryFactory[]

callout:factory[1]
<2> This registry has request scope, so a new one will be created for every request.
<3> Register the AuthorDataLoader whenever the loader for `"author"` is requested.

Add an `AuthorDataFetcher` which requests and uses this loader to populate a `ToDo` if the author when required.

source:AuthorDataFetcher[]

callout:singleton[1]
<2> Uses the author data loader defined above in the Factory.

=== GraphQL Factory

Finally, create a factory class that will bind the GraphQL schema to the code, types and fetchers.

source:GraphQLFactory[]

callout:factory[1]
callout:singleton[2]
<3> Wire up the query behavior.
<4> Wire up each mutators.
<5> Wire up how to populate a ToDo with authors if they are requested.

== Running the application

Run the following Docker command to get an instance of PostgreSQL running with a database named `todo`:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -d --rm \
     -p 5432:5432 \
     -e POSTGRES_USER=dbuser \
     -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=theSecretPassword \
     -e POSTGRES_DB=todo \
     postgres:12-alpine
----

Configure the default datasource to use the PostgreSQL database running in Docker:

resource:application.yml[tag=datasource]

<1> The JDBC URL matches the database name you used in the previous command (`todo`).
<2> Use PostgreSQL driver.
<3> Configure the PostgreSQL dialect.
<4> Schema migrations are handled by Flyway.

In a shell, set up the following environment variables to set the credentials to connect to the PostgreSQL database you started with Docker.

[source,bash]
----
export DATASOURCES_DEFAULT_USERNAME=dbuser
export DATASOURCES_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=theSecretPassword
----

common:runapp-instructions.adoc[]

When the application first runs, you will see in the logs that the migrations have been performed.

== Test the application

=== Manual smoke tests

Formulate a GraphQL query to retrieve all the current ToDos (there will be none to start with)

[source,json]
.Query
----
query {
  toDos {
    title,
    completed,
    author {
       username
    }
  }
}
----

Run the following cURL request:

[source, bash]
----
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/graphql' \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data-binary '{"query":"{ toDos { title, completed, author { username } } }"}'
----

[source,json]
.Response
----
{"data":{"toDos":[]}}
----

Create a ToDo, by issuing a mutation query and return the ID of the newly created ToDo:

[source,json]
.GraphQL Query
----
mutation {
  createToDo(title: "Create GraphQL Guide", author: "Tim Yates") {
    id
  }
}
----

Which translates to this cURL command:

[source, bash]
----
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/graphql' \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data-binary '{"query":"mutation { createToDo(title:\"Create GraphQL Guide\", author:\"Tim Yates\") { id } }"}'
----

[source,json]
.Response
----
{"data":{"createToDo":{"id":"1"}}}
----

This new ToDo then appears in the list of all ToDos with `completed` set to false:

[source, bash]
----
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/graphql' \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data-binary '{"query":"{ toDos { title, completed, author { username } } }"}'
----

[source,json]
.Response
----
{"data":{"toDos":[{"title":"Create GraphQL Guide","completed":false,"author":{"username":"Tim Yates"}}]}}
----

Mark it as completed by using this query with the ID from above:

[source,json]
.GraphQL query
----
mutation {
  completeToDo(id: 1)
}
----

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/graphql' \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data-binary '{"query":"mutation { completeToDo(id: 1) }"}'
----

[source,json]
.Response
----
{"data":{"completeToDo":true}}
----

Check this has been persisted in our model:

[source,bash]
.Query
----
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/graphql' \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data-binary '{"query":"{ toDos { title, completed } }"}'
----

[source,json]
.Response
----
{"data":{"toDos":[{"title":"Create GraphQL Guide","completed":true}]}}
----

=== Automated tests

For testing the application use the Micronaut HTTP Client to send a `POST` request to the `/graphql` endpoint.
Create the following class:

test:GraphQLControllerTest[]

callout:micronaut-test[1]
callout:http-client[2]

When this test is executed, Testcontainers will start a fresh copy of Postgres in a container and apply the migrations.
The tests then run "as in production" with real data in a real database.

To enable the tests to use this Dockerized database, create `application-test.yml` to overwrite the runtime datasource configuration.

testResource:application-test.yml[tag=testcontainers]

<1> Specify a https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/databases/jdbc/[TestContainers JDBC URL] to run our tests in a real but temporary PostgreSQL database

common:testApp-noheader.adoc[]

== GraphiQL

As an extra feature that will help during development, you can enable https://github.com/graphql/graphiql[GraphiQL].
GraphiQL is the GraphQL integrated development environment, and it executes GraphQL queries.

It should only be used for development, so it's not enabled by default.
Add the following configuration to enable it:

resource:application.yml[tag=graphiql]

Start the application again and open http://localhost:8080/graphiql in a browser.
GraphQL queries can be executed with integrated auto-completion:

image:graphiql-todo.png[]

common:graal-with-plugins.adoc[]

:exclude-for-languages:groovy

Start the native image and execute the same cURL request as before. You can also use the included GraphiQL browser to
execute the queries.

:exclude-for-languages:
