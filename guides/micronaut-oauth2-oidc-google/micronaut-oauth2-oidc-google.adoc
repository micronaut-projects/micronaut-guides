=== Views

Although Micronaut is primarily designed around message encoding / decoding, there are occasions where it is convenient to render a view on the server side.

To use https://www.thymeleaf.org/[Thymeleaf] Java template engine to render views within a Micronaut application add the following dependency on your classpath.

dependency:micronaut-views-thymeleaf[groupId=io.micronaut.views]

=== OAuth 2.0

Visit https://console.developers.google.com[https://console.developers.google.com] and create a new project:

image::google-1.png[]

You will also need to create OAuth 2.0 credentials for the project since Google does not do that automatically. From the sidebar, click the `Credentials` tab, the click `Create credentials` and choose `OAuth client ID` from the dropdown.

The Google Console will prompt for some information about your application such as the product name, a home page and a logo. On the next page, select *Web Application* type, and enter the redirect URL where the Micronaut app we will build next will wait for the callback.

You will then receive a client ID and secret.

To use OAuth 2.0 integration in your Micronaut App, add the following dependency:

dependency:micronaut-security-oauth2[groupId=io.micronaut.security]

Also add https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#jwt[Micronaut JWT support] dependencies:

dependency:micronaut-security-jwt[groupId=io.micronaut.security]

Add the following OAuth2 Configuration:

resource:application.yml[tag=oauth2]

<1> Set `micronaut.security.authentication` as `idtoken`. The idtoken provided by Google when the OAuth 2.0 Authorization code flow ends will be saved in a cookie. The id token is a signed JWT. For every request, Micronaut extracts the JWT from the Cookie and validates the JWT signature with the remote Json Web Key Set exposed by Google. JWKS is exposed by Google via the `jws-uri` entry of https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
<2> You can choose any name. The name you select, will be used in your routes. E.g. If you set `google` the login route for this OAuth 2.0 client is `/oauth/login/google`
<3> Client Secret. See previous screenshot.
<4> Client ID. See previous screenshot.
<5> `issuer` URL. It allows Micronaut to discover the configuration of the OpenID Connect server.
<6> Accept GET request to the `/logout` endpoint.

The previous configuration uses several placeholders. You will need to setup `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables.

[soruce, bash]
----
export OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=XXXXXXXXXX
export OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=YYYYYYYYYY
----

Check Google https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration[.well-known/openid-configuration documentation].

We want to use an **Authorization Code** grant type flow which it is described in the following diagram:

image::diagramm.png[]

=== Home

Create a controller to handle the requests to `/`. You are going to display the email of the authenticated person if any. Annotate the controller endpoint with `@View` since we are going to use a Thymeleaf template.

source:HomeController[]

<1> The class is defined as a controller with the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/http/annotation/Controller.html[@Controller] annotation mapped to the path `/`.
<2> Annotate with `io.micronaut.security.Secured` to configure secured access. The `SecurityRule.IS_ANONYMOUS` expression will allow access without authentication.
<3> Use https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/api/io/micronaut/views/View.html[View] annotation to specify which template would you like to render the response against.
<4> The https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/http/annotation/Get.html[@Get] annotation is used to map the `index` method to GET `/` requests.

Create a thymeleaf template:

resource:views/home.html[]

Also, note that we return an empty model in the controller. However, we are accessing `security` in the thymeleaf template.

- The https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/views/model/security/SecurityViewModelProcessor.html[SecurityViewModelProcessor] injects into the model a `security` map with the authenticated user. See https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/guide/index.html#views-security[User in a view] documentation.

=== Custom ID token claims validation

Imagine you want to allow sign-in with Google but only to users' in your organization.

Google OAuth consent screen settings allows you to do that:

image::google-5.png[]

However, we could also achieve this programmatically. Google id token contains a claim named `hd` which stands for `hosted domain`.

We can create a configuration object:

source:ApplicationConfiguration[]

Backed by a `@ConfigurationProperties` annotated class:

source:ApplicationConfigurationProperties[]

and then implement a `OpenIdClaimsValidator` bean. Micronaut validates the id token against every bean of type `OpenIdClaimsValidator`. If the id token `hd` claim does not match the value configured, it is considered invalid.

source:HostedDomainClaimValidator[]

Add to `src/main/resources/application.yaml`

[source, yaml]
----
app:
  hosted-domain: 'objectcomputing.com'
----

if you start the app, you will only be able to sign in with a Google Account within OCI organization.

After you execute the native image, navigate to localhost:8080 and authenticate with Google.
