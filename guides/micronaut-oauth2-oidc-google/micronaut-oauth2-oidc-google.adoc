=== OAuth 2.0

Visit https://console.developers.google.com[https://console.developers.google.com] and create a new project:

image::google-1.png[]

You will also need to create OAuth 2.0 credentials for the project since Google does not do that automatically. From the sidebar, click the `Credentials` tab, the click `Create credentials` and choose `OAuth client ID` from the dropdown.

The Google Console will prompt for some information about your application such as the product name, a home page, and a logo. On the next page, select *Web Application* type, and enter the redirect URL where the Micronaut application we will build next will wait for the callback.

You will then receive a client ID and secret.

To use OAuth 2.0 integration in your Micronaut application, add the following dependency:

dependency:micronaut-security-oauth2[groupId=io.micronaut.security]

Also add https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/#jwt[Micronaut JWT support] dependencies:

dependency:micronaut-security-jwt[groupId=io.micronaut.security]

Add the following OAuth2 Configuration:

common:yaml-dependency.adoc[]

resource:application.yml[tag=oauth2]

callout:authentication-idtoken[number=1,arg0=Google]
<2> You can choose any name. The name you select, will be used in your routes. E.g. If you set `google` the login route for this OAuth 2.0 client is `/oauth/login/google`
<3> Client Secret. See previous screenshot.
<4> Client ID. See previous screenshot.
<5> `issuer` URL. It allows the Micronaut framework to discover the configuration of the OpenID Connect server.
<6> Accept GET request to the `/logout` endpoint.

The previous configuration uses several placeholders. You will need to set up `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables.

[soruce, bash]
----
export OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=XXXXXXXXXX
export OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=YYYYYYYYYY
----

Check Google https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration[.well-known/openid-configuration documentation].

We want to use an **Authorization Code** grant type flow which it is described in the following diagram:

image::diagramm.png[]

=== Home

Create a controller to handle the requests to `/`. You will display the email of the authenticated person if any. Annotate the controller endpoint with `@View` since we will use a Thymeleaf template.

source:HomeController[]

callout:controller[number=1,arg0=/]
callout:secured-anonymous[number=2]
<3> Use https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/api/io/micronaut/views/View.html[View] annotation to specify which template to use to render the response.
<4> The @api@/io/micronaut/http/annotation/Get.html[@Get] annotation maps the `index` method to GET `/` requests.

Create a thymeleaf template:

resource:views/home.html[]

Also, note that we return an empty model in the controller. However, we are accessing `security` in the thymeleaf template.

- The https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/api/io/micronaut/views/model/security/SecurityViewModelProcessor.html[SecurityViewModelProcessor^] injects into the model a `security` map with the authenticated user. See https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/guide/#security-model-enhancement[User in a view] documentation.

=== Custom ID token claims validation

Imagine you want to allow sign-in with Google but only to users' in your organization.

Google OAuth consent screen settings allows you to do that:

image::google-5.png[]

However, we could also achieve this programmatically. Google id token contains a claim named `hd` which stands for `hosted domain`.

We can create a configuration object:

source:ApplicationConfiguration[]

Backed by a `@ConfigurationProperties` annotated class:

source:ApplicationConfigurationProperties[]

and then implement a `OpenIdClaimsValidator` bean. The Micronaut framework validates the id token against every bean of type `OpenIdClaimsValidator`. If the id token `hd` claim does not match the value configured, it is considered invalid.

source:HostedDomainClaimValidator[]

Add to `src/main/resources/application.yaml`

[source, yaml]
----
app:
  hosted-domain: 'objectcomputing.com'
----

if you start the application, you will only be able to sign in with a Google Account within the OCI organization.

After you execute the native executable, navigate to localhost:8080 and authenticate with Google.
