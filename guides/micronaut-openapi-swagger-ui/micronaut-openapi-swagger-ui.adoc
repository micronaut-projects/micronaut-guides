== Swagger UI

To simplify the visualization of the OpenAPI specification, we are going to use https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/[Swagger UI]

____
Swagger UI allows anyone — be it your development team or your end consumers — to visualize and interact with the API’s resources without having any of the implementation logic in place. It’s automatically generated from your OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) Specification, with the visual documentation making it easy for back end implementation and client side consumption.
____

To generate Swagger-UI HTML, create an `openapi.properties` file in the root of your project and add:

[source, properties]
----
swagger-ui.enabled=true
----

You can write a test to verify that Swagger-UI HTML is generated at compile-time.

test:SwaggerUiGeneratedTest[]
callout:micronaut-test-start-application-false[1]

== Expose Swagger-UI

We can expose the Swagger-UI HTML generated at compile-time as a static resource with the following configuration:

resource:application.properties[tag=swagger-ui]

You can test the Swagger-UI is available:

test:SwaggerUiTest[]
callout:micronaut-test[1]
callout:http-client[2]
