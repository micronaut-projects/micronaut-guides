== Create an Amazon S3 bucket

First, we are going to
https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/create-bucket.html[create an Amazon S3 bucket]
using the `aws` CLI:

[source,bash]
----
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket micronaut-guide-object-storage --region=us-east-1
----

WARNING: Bucket names must be unique across all AWS accounts.

[TIP]
====
If you want to create the bucket in a region other than `us-east-1`, you need additional parameters. For example, to
create the bucket in the `eu-west-3` region:

[source,bash]
----
aws s3api create-bucket \
          --bucket micronaut-guide-object-storage \
          --region eu-west-3 \
          --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=eu-west-3
----
====

Then, configure the bucket in `application.yml`:

resource:application.yml[tag=object-storage]

== Controller API

external:micronaut-object-storage-base/controller-api.adoc[]

source:ProfilePicturesController[tags=begin-class|end-class]

callout:controller[number=1,arg0=/pictures]
callout:executes-on[2]
callout:object-storage-operations[number=3,arg0=aws,arg1=AwsS3Operations]
callout:object-storage-host-resolver[4]

=== Upload endpoint

Implement the upload endpoint by receiving the file from the HTTP client via `CompletedFileUpload`, and the `userId` path
parameter. Upload it to S3 using
https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-object-storage/latest/api/io/micronaut/objectstorage/aws/AwsS3Operations.html[AwsS3Operations],
and then return its `ETag` in an HTTP response header to the client:

source:ProfilePicturesController[tags=upload,indent=0]

callout:object-storage-key[1]
callout:object-storage-request[2]
callout:object-storage-upload-response[number=3,arg0=https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/services/s3/model/PutObjectResponse.html,arg1=PutObjectResponse]
<4> The upload can be customised by using Amazon's https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/services/s3/model/PutObjectRequest.Builder.html[PutObjectRequest.Builder] methods.
callout:object-storage-location[5]
callout:object-storage-response[6]

=== Download endpoint

external:micronaut-object-storage-base/download-endpoint.adoc[]

source:ProfilePicturesController[tags=download,indent=0]
<1> The retrieve operation returns an `ObjectStorageEntry`, in this case an
https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-object-storage/latest/api/io/micronaut/objectstorage/aws/AwsS3ObjectStorageEntry.html[AwsS3ObjectStorageEntry],
which allows accessing the AWS-specific
https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/services/s3/model/GetObjectResponse.html[GetObjectResponse]
object in case you need more details about the object.

=== Delete endpoint

== Testing

We can test our application from the command line.

=== Uploading a profile picture

external:micronaut-object-storage-base/testing-upload.adoc[]

We can use the `aws` CLI to verify that the file has actually been uploaded to an S3 bucket:

[source,bash]
----
aws s3 ls s3://micronaut-guide-object-storage/
----

=== Download a profile picture

external:micronaut-object-storage-base/testing-download.adoc[]

=== Delete a profile picture

[source,bash]
----
aws s3 ls s3://micronaut-guide-object-storage/
----

=== Cleanup

Once you are done with this guide, you can remove the bucket from S3 to not leave stale resources:

[source,bash]
----
aws s3api delete-bucket --bucket micronaut-guide-object-storage --region eu-west-3
----
