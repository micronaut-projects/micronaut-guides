=== Thymeleaf view

Create a Thymeleaf view to render the UI for the controller:

resource:views/home.html[]

Note that we return an empty model in the controller `index()` method. However, we are accessing `security` in the Thymeleaf template.
The Micronaut Security https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/api/io/micronaut/views/model/security/SecurityViewModelProcessor.html[SecurityViewModelProcessor]
injects a `security` map into the model with the authenticated user data.
See the https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/guide/#security-model-enhancement[User in a view] documentation.
