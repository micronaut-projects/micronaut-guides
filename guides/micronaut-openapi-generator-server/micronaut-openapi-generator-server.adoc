== Getting Started

In this guide we will write an https://www.openapis.org[OpenAPI] definition file and then use it to generate a Java Micronaut server API with https://openapi-generator.tech[OpenAPI Generator].

____
OpenAPI Generator allows generation of API client libraries (SDK generation), server stubs, documentation and configuration automatically given an OpenAPI Spec (both 2.0 and 3.0 are supported).
____

Then we will add internal logic to the API and test our implementation.

common:requirements.adoc[]

common:completesolution.adoc[]

== Installing OpenAPI Generator

To use OpenAPI Generator we need to https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator#1---installation[install OpenAPI Generator CLI].

We will use the jar option. https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator#13---download-jar[Download it] and store it in the directory that you want to use for this project.

Next, open terminal in the same directory. To verify that generator works correctly run the `help` command:
[source,bash]
----
java -jar openapi-generator-cli-XXX.jar help
----

It should provide a description and a list of commands.

[NOTE]
===============================
All the options for installation are given at the https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/installation["CLI Installation" guide on the OpenAPI Generator website].

In particular:

* run `brew install openapi-generator` for Homebrew installation,
* or read the link:https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/installation/#bash-launcher-script["Bash Launcher Script" section]
to set up a bash script with automatic updates

If you installed the generator with a package manager or bash launcher script, simply run
[source,bash]
----
openapi-generator-cli help
----
===============================

NOTE: You can also use the https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/online[OpenAPI Generator Online Service] but its usage
is not covered by this guide.


== Creating the API definition file

We will now create a definition file, that will describe our server API, including the available paths and operations on them.

//NOTE: You can get the complete version of the config file
//that we are about to create here:
//link:{sourceDir}@sourceDir@/library-definition.yaml[library-definition.yaml].
//However, we do recommend you to look through each of its sections for better understanding.

OpenAPI generator supports `.yaml` and `.json` file formats for the definition file.
We will use YAML due its simplicity and human readability.

In the directory where you downloaded the OpenAPI generator CLI, create a file named `library-definition.yaml` and open it in your
favourite text editor.

=== General server info

Paste the following text to the file:

resource:library-definition.yaml[tag=info]

<1> The version that will be used for parsing.
<2> The info object contains general information about the API.
<3> Tags will be used to logically structure different paths.

NOTE: If you are new to OpenAPI, you might be interested in reading the
link:https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/[OpenAPI guide] or the
link:https://swagger.io/specification/[OpenAPI 3.0.0 specification] after you finish this guide.

=== Paths and operations definition

We will proceed by defining a path that will be available in our API. Paste the following to our file:

resource:library-definition.yaml[tags=paths|search]

<1> We define the `GET` operation on the `/search` path.
<2> We use the `books` tag that we previously defined. Note that for each tag a controller will be generated
that will implement its operations.
<3> The `search` operation id will be used as method name for the given path.
<4> We define two parameters of type string that user should supply in query.
<5> Validation can be used on parameters. In this case book name must contain at least three characters.
<6> The `responses` object describes the response codes that can be produced.
It also defines the structure of body if any.
<7> In case of correct request we define the body to contain a list of `BookInfo` objects. The schema for the book info
object will be defined later in `components/schemas` section of definition.
<8> The `"400"` status code will be produced by Micronaut in case of bad request, like an incorrect type supplied or
failed validation. Even though Micronaut handles it automatically and no implementation is needed on our side, we add it
for a complete API specification.

NOTE: You can read more about parameter descriptions in the
link:https://swagger.io/docs/specification/describing-parameters/["Describing Parameters" OpenAPI guide].
All the available types and their validations are described in
link:https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/data-types/["Data Models (Schemas)" OpenAPI guide].

We will define another path with a `POST` operation:

resource:library-definition.yaml[tag=add]

<1> We define the `POST` method for the `/add` path, and add the same tag `books` to it.
<2> We specify that a body is required and what are the supported content-types for it.
(in this case only `application/json`, but multiple can be allowed).
<3> We write that `BookInfo` object is required to be in the request body.
We reference the same `BookInfo` schema that we will define next.

NOTE: To read more about body definitions, see the
link:https://swagger.io/docs/specification/describing-request-body/["Describing Request Body" OpenAPI guide].

=== Schemas

We will add schemas to the definition file:

resource:library-definition.yaml[tag=components]

<1> We define the `BookInfo` schema inside then `components/schemas` section.
From this schema a Java class will be generated with the same `BookInfo` class name.
<2> We define all the properties of `BookInfo`, including required validation on them. An abbreviated form is used
for some YAML lists and dictionaries to reduce the number of rows and simplify readability.
<3> We reference another schema to be used as a property.
<4> We define `BookAvailability` schema to be an enum with three available values.
A Java `BookAvailability` class will be generated with given enum values based on our definition.

NOTE: You can read more about writing schemas in the
link:https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/["Data Models (Schemas)" OpenAPI guide].

Save the file and proceed to the next part of the guide.
//Altogether it should look like this: link:@sourceDir@/library-definition.yaml[library-definition.yaml].

== Generating server API from template

Now we will generate server API files from our definition.
Open the terminal in the same directory as `library-definition.yaml` file and run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
java -jar openapi-generator-cli-XXX.jar generate \
    -g java-micronaut-server \# <1>
    -i library-definition.yaml \# <2>
    -o ./ \# <3>
    -p controllerPackage=example.micronaut.controller \# <4>
    -p modelPackage=example.micronaut.model \# <5>
    -p build=@build@ \# <6>
    -p test=junit# <7>
----
<1> Specify that we will use Java Micronaut server generator.
<2> Specify our OpenAPI definition file as `library-definition.yaml` which we just created.
<3> Specify the output directory to be the current directory (`./`).
You can specify it to be a different one if you want (e.g. `library-server`).
<4> We provide generator-specific properties starting with `-p`.
We want all the controllers to be generated in the `example.micronaut.controller` package.
<5> We want all the models (data models, like `BookInfo`) to be in `example.micronaut.model` package.
<6> We want to use @build@ as build tool. The supported values are `gradle`, `maven` and `all`.
If nothing is specified, both Maven and Gradle files are generated.
<7> We want to use JUnit 5 for testing. The supported values are `junit` (JUnit 5) and `spock`.
If nothing is specified, `junit` is used by default.

//[WARNING]
//=========
//If you are using Windows command prompt, run:
//=========
//[source,bash]
//----
//java -jar openapi-generator-cli-XXX.jar generate -g java-micronaut-server -i library-definition.yaml -o ./ -p controllerPackage=example.micronaut.controller -p modelPackage=example.micronaut.model -p build=@build@ -p test=junit
//----

[NOTE]
=========
If you want to view all the available parameters for micronaut server generator, run
[source,bash]
----
java -jar openapi-generator-cli-XXX.jar config-help \
    -g java-micronaut-server
----
=========

[NOTE]
=========
If you plan to change the definition file and regenerate files, consider setting the `-p generateControllerAsAbstract=true`
parameter (we don't recommend doing it during this guide, though). In this case an abstract class will be generated
for the API, while all the logic needs to be implemented in a different class (that extends the API abstract class).
This way your changes won't be overwritten by generation, but the API will be updated.
=========

After running, the OpenAPI generator CLI will output information about generated files.
Now you can open the directory in your favorite IDE or text editor.

You should see the following directory structure:

[source,text]
----
./
├── docs
│   └── ... # <1>

----
<1> The `docs/` directory contains automatically generated Markdown files with documentation about your API.
<2> Starts the Micronaut server with detected controllers.
<3> The `BooksController` is generated based on paths with `books` tag. It is generated in the package we specified
for controllers earlier.
<4> Two files are generated in the `models/` directory based on schemas we provided in the definition.
<5> Config file for Micronaut is generated with a default value for server port and other parameters.
<6> Tests are generated for all the controllers and models.

== Writing the app

Next, create a persistence with Micronaut Data JDBC, Database schema generation with Flyway, and use it from the generated code.

common:data-jdbc-mysql[]

common:flyway.adoc[]

resource:db/migration/V1__schema.sql[]

=== MappedEntity

Create an Entity:

source:BookEntity[]

callout:mapped-entity[1]
callout:mapped-entity-id[2]

=== Writing a Service

common:jdbc-repository-intro[]

source:BookRepository[]

callout:jdbcrepository[1]
<2> `BookEntity`, the entity to treat as the root entity for the purposes of querying, is established either from the method signature or from the generic type parameter specified to the `GenericRepository` interface.
callout:jpa-specification-executor[3]
callout:jpa-specification-findall[4]

Create a class to encapsulate the `Predicate` creation.

source:BookSpecifications[]

== Writing the Controller Logic

If you look inside the generated `BookInfo.java` file, you can see the class that was generated with all the parameters
based on our definition. Notice that the constructor signature has two parameters, which were defined as `required` in the
YAML definition file:

[source,java]
----
    public BookInfo(String name, BookAvailability availability);
----

Along with that it has getters and setters for parameters and Jackson serialization annotations.

=== Implementing Controller Methods

Now open `BooksController`. The class should have two methods named the same
as the operations we created in the definition file. The methods have Micronaut framework annotations describing the
required API. We will now write their bodies.

First, inject `BookRepository`:
source:controller/BooksController[tag=inject,indent=0]
callout:constructor-di[number=1,arg0=BookRepository]

Next, replace the `search` method implementation:

source:controller/BooksController[tag=search,indent=0]
callout:executes-on[1]
<2> Criteria API allows you to build a query programmatically and at the runtime.

And finally, we will implement the `addBook` method:
source:controller/BooksController[tag=addBook,indent=0]
callout:executes-on[1]
callout:at-status[2]


common:runapp.adoc[]

You can send a few requests to the paths to test the application. We will use cURL for that.

* The search for book names, that have `"Guide"` as substring should return 2 `BookInfo` objects:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl "localhost:8080/search?book-name=Guide"
----
+
[source,bash]
----
[{"name":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","availability":"reserved","author":"Douglas Adams"},
{"name":"Java Guide for Beginners","availability":"available"}]
----

* The search for a substring `"Gu"` in name will return a `"Bad Request"` error, since we have defined the `book-name` parameter to
have at least three characters:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -i "localhost:8080/search?book-name=Gu"
----
+
[source,bash]
----
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
date: ****
content-length: 180
connection: keep-alive

{"message":"Bad Request","_embedded":{"errors":[{"message":"bookName: size must be between 3 and 2147483647"}]},
"_links":{"self":{"href":"/search?book-name=Gu","templated":false}}}
----

* Addition of a new book should not result in errors:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -i -d '{"name": "My book", "availability": "available"}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST localhost:8080/add
----
+
[source,bash]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
date: Tue, 1 Feb 2022 00:01:57 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
content-length: 0
connection: keep-alive
----
You can then verify that the addition was successful by performing another search.

== Testing the Application

common:testcontainers-mysql.adoc[]

=== Testing Models

As we have noticed previously, some files were generated as templates for tests.
We will implement tests for models inside these files. Their main purpose will be to verify that we correctly described
our API in the YAML file, and therefore the generated files behave as expected.

We will begin by writing tests for the required properties of `BookInfo` object.
Define the following imports:
test:model/BookInfoTest[tag=imports]

Add the following methods inside the `BookInfoTest` class:
test:model/BookInfoTest[tag=requiredProperties]
<1> Instruct Micronaut to inject an instance of the link:https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#beanValidation[Validator].
`Validator` will automatically validate parameters and response bodies annotated with `@Valid` in the controller.
We will use it test the validations manually.
<2> Verify that the validator doesn't produce any violations on a correct `BookInfo` instance.
<3> Verify that `null` value is not allowed for the `name` property, since the property is marked as required.
<4> Perform the same tests for the required `availability` property.

We will then write similar test for other properties:
test:model/BookInfoTest[tag=otherProperties]
<1> Verify that there are no violations for both `null` or `"Lewis Carol"` used as a value for the `author` property.
<2> Verify that there is a violation in case the name is too short (at least tree characters are required).
<3> Verify that there are no violations for valid values of the `ISBN` property.
<4> Verify that there is a violation in case the value doesn't match the required pattern (A space is present).

Finally, we will test JSON serialization and parsing by writing a simple controller and client:
test:model/BookInfoTest[tags=annotations|jsonSerialization]
<1> Create a simple controller that will respond to requests on the `/bookinfo` path.
<2> Specify the `spec.name` property for this test class.
<3> Use the link:https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#metaScopes[Requires] annotation to specify that
this controller will only be used if the `spec.name` property is set to `BookInfoTest`. This will prevent the controller
from running during other tests.
<4> Define a `GET` method that will return a `BookInfo` object in the `application/json` format.
<5> Create a test that will send a request to the server and verify that the response matches the desired object
(This means that both serialization and parsing work correctly).

Similarly, we can implement tests for the `BookAvailability` class. The details are not shown in this guide.

=== Testing the Controller

We will write test for the two paths of `BookController`.

If you open the `BooksControllerTest`, you can see that templates of tests were generated for both paths with examples of requests to corresponding paths. The templates can be used to simplify and speed up test writing.

We will simply replace the contents of the file:

test:controller/BooksControllerTest[]

callout:micronaut-test[1]
callout:http-client[2]
callout:http-request[3]
<4> Verify that addition of book info was successful by checking the status code.
callout:binding-json-array[5]
callout:body-method[6]
<7> Verify that there are exactly two books with `"Guide"` substring in title.

common:testApp-noheader.adoc[]

All the tests should run successfully.

common:graal-with-plugins.adoc[]

== Next steps

=== Add Security

We could have defined our security requirements by adding a security schema to the `library-definition.yaml` file.
For example, we will add HTTP Basic authentication:

[source,yaml]
----
paths:
  /search:
    # ... #
  /add:
    post:
      # ... #
      security:
        - MyBasicAuth: [] # <2>
components:
  schemas:
    # ... #
  securitySchemes:
    MyBasicAuth: # <1>
      type: http
      scheme: basic
----
<1> Define a security schema inside the `components/securitySchemes`. We want to use Basic auth for authentication.
<2> Add the schema to the paths that you want to secure. In this case we want to restrict access to
adding books into our library.

NOTE: You can read more about describing various authentication in the
link:https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/["Authentication and Authorization" OpenAPI guide].

The generator will then annotate such endpoints with the
link:https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/#secured[Secured] annotation accordingly:

[source,java]
----
@Secured(SecurityRule.IS_AUTHENTICATED)
public Mono<Object> addBook( /* ... */ ){ /* ... */ }
----

You will then need to implement an
link:https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/#authenticationProviders[AuthenticationProvider]
that satisfies your needs. If you want to finish implementing the basic authentication, continue to the
link:https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/micronaut-security-basicauth.html[Micronaut Basic Auth guide] and replicate
steps to create the `AuthenticationProvider` and appropriate tests.

NOTE: You can also read link:https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/[Micronaut Security documentation]
or link:https://micronaut.io/guides[Micronaut guides] about security to learn more about
the supported Authorization strategies.

=== Generate Micronaut Client

You can generate a Micronaut client based on the same `library-definition.yaml` file.

Run the following in terminal to create client in the `library-client` directory:

[source,bash]
----
java -jar openapi-generator-cli-XXX.jar generate \
    -g java-micronaut-client \
    -i library-definition.yaml \
    -o library-client \
    -p apiPackage=example.micronaut.api \
    -p modelPackage=example.micronaut.model \
    -p build=@build@ \
    -p test=junit
----

=== Add Server URL Information

If you have your server running, you can add your website URL to it in the YAML definition file:
[source,yaml]
----
# ... #
servers:
  - url: 'http://my.website.com'
----

=== Generate User-Friendly Documentation

You can generate documentation in html file inside the `html-docs/` directory by running
[source,bash]
----
java -jar openapi-generator-cli-XXX.jar generate \
    -g html2 \
    -i library-definition.yaml \
    -o html-docs
----
