common:header.adoc[]

In this guide, we will create two microservices that will use https://kafka.apache.org/[Kafka] to communicate with each other in an asynchronous and decoupled way.

== What you will need

To complete this guide, you will need the following:

* Some time on your hands
* A decent text editor or IDE
* JDK 1.8 or greater installed with `JAVA_HOME` configured appropriately
* https://www.docker.io/gettingstarted/#h_installation[Docker] and https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Docker Compose] installed if you will be running Kafka in Docker, and for running tests.

common:completesolution.adoc[]

== Writing the application

Let's describe the microservices you will build through the guide.

* `books` - It returns a list of books. It uses a domain consisting of a book name and ISBN. It also publishes a message in Kafka every time a book is accessed.

* `analytics` - It connects to Kafka to update the analytics for every book (a counter). It also exposes an endpoint to get the analytics.

common:annotationprocessors.adoc[]

=== Books Microservice

Create the `books` microservice using the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#cli[Micronaut Command Line Interface] or with https://launch.micronaut.io[Micronaut Launch].

[source,bash]
----
mn @books:cli-command@ --features=kafka,reactor,graalvm,serialization-jackson example.micronaut.books --build=@build@ --lang=@lang@
----

common:build-lang-arguments.adoc[]

If you use Micronaut Launch, select Micronaut Application as application type and add the `kafka`, `reactor`, `graalvm`, and `serialization-jackson` features.

The previous command creates a directory named `books` and a Micronaut application inside it with default package `example.micronaut`.

In addition to the dependencies added by the above features, we also need a test dependency for the http://www.awaitility.org/[Awaitility] library:

:dependencies:
dependency:awaitility[groupId=org.awaitility,version=@awaitilityVersion@,scope=test]
:dependencies:

Create a `Book` POJO:

source:Book[app=books]

To keep this guide simple there is no database persistence - `BookService` keeps the list of books in memory:

source:BookService[app=books]

Create a `BookController` class to handle incoming HTTP requests to the `books` microservice:

source:BookController[app=books]

<1> The @api@/io/micronaut/http/annotation/Controller.html[@Controller] annotation defines the class as a controller mapped to the root URI `/books`
callout:constructor-di[number=2,arg0=BookService]
callout:get[number=3,arg0=listAll,arg1=/books]
callout:get[number=4,arg0=findBook,arg1=/books/{isbn}]

=== Analytics Microservice

Create the `analytics` microservice using the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#cli[Micronaut Command Line Interface] or with https://launch.micronaut.io[Micronaut Launch].

[source,bash]
----
mn @analytics:cli-command@ --features=kafka,graalvm,serialization-jackson example.micronaut.analytics --build=@build@ --lang=@lang@
----

common:build-lang-arguments.adoc[]

If you use Micronaut Launch, select Micronaut Application as application type and add the `kafka` and `graalvm` features.

Create a `Book` POJO:

source:Book[app=analytics]

NOTE: This `Book` POJO is the same as the one in the `books` microservice. In a real application this would be in a shared library but to keep things simple we'll just duplicate it.

Create a `BookAnalytics` POJO:

source:BookAnalytics[app=analytics]

To keep this guide simple there is no database persistence - `AnalyticsService` keeps book analytics in memory:

source:AnalyticsService[app=analytics]

<1> Keep the book analytics in memory
<2> Initialize and update the analytics for the book passed as parameter
<3> Return all the analytics

Write a test for `AnalyticsService`:

test:AnalyticsServiceTest[app=analytics]

Create a Controller to expose the analytics:

source:AnalyticsController[app=analytics]

<1> Just expose the analytics

[NOTE]
====
The application doesn't expose the method `updateBookAnalytics` created in `AnalyticsService`. This method will be invoked when reading messages from Kafka.
====

To run the tests:

:exclude-for-build:maven

[source, bash]
.analytics

:exclude-for-build:maven

[source,bash]
.books
----
./gradlew run

----

:exclude-for-build:

You can use `curl` to test the application:

[source, bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/books
----

[source,json]
----
[{"isbn":"1491950358","name":"Building Microservices"},{"isbn":"1680502395","name":"Release It!"},{"isbn":"0321601912","name":"Continuous Delivery"}]
----

[source, bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/books/1491950358
----

[source,json]
----
{"isbn":"1491950358","name":"Building Microservices"}
----

[source, bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8081/analytics
----

[source,json]
----
[]
----

Note that getting the analytics returns an empty list because the applications are not communicating with each other (yet).

common:test-resources-kafka.adoc[]

== Kafka and the Micronaut Framework

=== Install Kafka

A fast way to start using Kafka is https://hub.docker.com/r/confluentinc/cp-kafka/[via Docker]. Create this `docker-compose.yml` file:

zipInclude:docker/docker-compose.yml[]

<1> Zookeeper uses port 2181 by default, but you can change the value if necessary.
<2> Kafka uses port 9092 by default, but you can change the value if necessary.

Start Zookeeper and Kafka (use CTRL-C to stop both):

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up
----

Alternatively you can https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart[install and run a local Kafka instance].

=== Books Microservice

The generated code will use the Test Resources plugin to start a local Kafka broker inside Docker, and configure the connection URL.

==== Create Kafka client (producer)

Let's create an interface to send messages to Kafka. The Micronaut framework will implement the interface at compilation time:

source:AnalyticsClient[app=books]

<1> Set the topic name
<2> Send the `Book` POJO. The Framework will automatically convert it to JSON before sending it

==== Create Tests

We could use mocks to test the message sending logic between `BookController`, `AnalyticsFilter`, and `AnalyticsClient`, but it's more realistic to use a running Kafka broker this is why <<test-resources,Test Resources>> are used to run Kafka inside a Docker container.

Write a test for `BookController` to verify the interaction with `AnalyticsService`:

test:BookControllerTest[app=books]

callout:test-instance-per-class[1]
<2> Dependency injection for the `AnalyticsListener` class declared below, a Kafka listener class that replicates the functionality of the class of the same name in the `analytics` microservice
<3> Dependency injection for an HTTP client that the Micronaut framework will implement at compile to make calls to `BookController`
:exclude-for-languages:java,groovy
callout:atfield[4]
callout:lateinit[5]
<6> Use the `HttpClient` to retrieve a `Book`, which will trigger sending a message with Kafka
<7> Wait a few seconds for the message to arrive; it should happen very quickly, but the message will be sent on a separate thread
<8> Verify that the message was received and has the correct data
<9> Wait a few seconds to make sure no message is sent
:exclude-for-languages:
:exclude-for-languages:kotlin
<4> Use the `HttpClient` to retrieve a `Book`, which will trigger sending a message with Kafka
<5> Wait a few seconds for the message to arrive; it should happen very quickly, but the message will be sent on a separate thread
<6> Verify that the message was received and has the correct data
<7> Wait a few seconds to make sure no message is sent
:exclude-for-languages:

==== Send Analytics information automatically

Sending a message to Kafka is as simple as injecting `AnalyticsClient` and calling the `updateAnalytics` method. The goal is to do it automatically every time a book is returned, i.e., every time there is a call to `\http://localhost:8080/books/{isbn}`.
To achieve this we will create an https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#filters[Http Server Filter].
Create the `AnalyticsFilter` class:

source:AnalyticsFilter[app=books]

<1> Annotate the class with `@Filter` and define the Ant-style matcher pattern to intercept all calls to the desired URIs
<2> The class must implement `HttpServerFilter`
<3> Dependency injection for the Kafka `AnalyticsClient`
<4> Implement the `doFilter` method
<5> Execute the request; this will invoke the controller action
<6> Get the response from the controller and return the body as a `Book`
<7> If the book is found, use the Kafka client to send a message

=== Analytics Microservice

==== Create Kafka consumer

Create a new class to act as a consumer of the messages sent to Kafka by the `books` microservice. The Micronaut framework will implement logic to invoke the consumer at compile time. Create the `AnalyticsListener` class:

source:AnalyticsListener[app=analytics]

<1> Do not load this bean for the test environment - this lets us run the tests without having Kafka running
<2> Annotate the class with `@KafkaListener` to indicate that this bean will consume messages from Kafka
<3> Constructor injection for `AnalyticsService`
<4> Annotate the method with `@Topic` and specify the topic name to use
<5> Call `AnalyticsService` to update the analytics for the book

=== Running the application

Start the `books` microservice:

:exclude-for-build:maven

[source,bash]
.books
----
./gradlew run
----

[source]
----
16:35:55.614 [main] INFO  io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut - Startup completed in 576ms. Server Running: http://localhost:8080
----

:exclude-for-build:

:exclude-for-build:gradle

[source,bash]
.books
----
./mvnw mn:run
----

[source]
----
16:35:55.614 [main] INFO  io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut - Startup completed in 576ms. Server Running: http://localhost:8080
----

:exclude-for-build:

Execute a `curl` request to get one book:

[source, bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/books/1491950358
----

[source,json]
----
{"isbn":"1491950358","name":"Building Microservices"}
----

Start the `analytics` microservice:

:exclude-for-build:maven

[source,bash]
.analytics
----
./gradlew run
----

[source]
----
16:35:55.614 [main] INFO  io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut - Startup completed in 623ms. Server Running: http://localhost:8081
----

:exclude-for-build:

:exclude-for-build:gradle

[source,bash]
.analytics
----
./mvnw mn:run
----

[source]
----
16:35:55.614 [main] INFO  io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut - Startup completed in 623ms. Server Running: http://localhost:8081
----

:exclude-for-build:

The application will consume and process the message automatically after startup.

Now, use `curl` to see the analytics:

[source, bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8081/analytics
----

[source,json]
----
[{"bookIsbn":"1491950358","count":1}]
----

Update the `curl` command to the `books` microservice to retrieve other books and repeat the invocations, then re-run the `curl` command to the `analytics` microservice to see that the counts increase.

common:graal-with-plugins-multi.adoc[]

:exclude-for-languages:groovy

Start the native executables for the two microservices and run the same `curl` request as before to check that everything works with GraalVM.
