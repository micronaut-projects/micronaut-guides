== Home Controller

Next, create a controller that redirects to the swagger-ui endpoint.

source:HomeController[]

<1> callout:controller[arg0=/]
<2> callout:get-generic[]
<3> callout:swagger-hidden[]

Write a test that verifies the redirection and checks that the endpoint is not included in the OpenAPI specification:

test:HomeControllerTest[]

<1> callout:property[]
<2> callout:micronaut-test[]
<3> callout:http-client[]
<4> The root endpoint is not included in the OpenAPI specification.
