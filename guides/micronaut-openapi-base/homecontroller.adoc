== Home Controller

Next, create a controller that redirects to the swagger-ui endpoint.

source:HomeController[]
callout:controller[number=1,arg0=/]
callout:get-generic[number=2]
callout:swagger-hidden[3]

Write a test that verifies the redirection and checks that the endpoint is not included in the OpenAPI specification:

test:HomeControllerTest[]
callout:property[1]
callout:micronaut-test[2]
callout:http-client[3]
<4> The root endpoint is not included in the OpenAPI specification.
