== Home Controller

Next, create a controller that redirects to the swagger-ui endpoint.

source:HomeController[]
callout:controller[arg0=/]
callout:get-generic[]
callout:swagger-hidden[]

Write a test that verifies the redirection and checks that the endpoint is not included in the OpenAPI specification:

test:HomeControllerTest[]
callout:property[]
callout:micronaut-test[]
callout:http-client[]
<4> The root endpoint is not included in the OpenAPI specification.
