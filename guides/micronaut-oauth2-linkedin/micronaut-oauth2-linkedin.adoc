== OAuth 2.0

To provide https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/consumer/integrations/self-serve/sign-in-with-linkedin[Sign in with LinkedIn]
with https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/authorization-code-flow[Authorization Code Flow],
you need to visit https://www.linkedin.com/developers/[linkedin.com/developers/] and:

=== Create a LinkedIn App

image::linkedin-create-app.png[]

=== Add Sign in with LinkedIn Product

image::linked-in-sign-in-with-linked-in.png[]

image::linkedin-add-signin-with-linked-popup.png[]

=== Configure Authorized Redirect URL

Go to the `Auth` tab.

image::linked-in-auth.png[]

- Save your client id and client secret. You will need them to configure your Micronaut applications.
- Register `\http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback/linkedin`. By creating a client named `linkedin` in the Micronaut application, route `/oauth/callback/linkedin` is registered.
- After you add `Add Sign in with LinkedIn` the scopes `r_liteprofile` and `r_emailaddress` will appear. We will configure the Micronaut application to request scope `r_liteprofile`.

=== Views

Although the Micronaut framework is primarily designed around message encoding / decoding, there are occasions where it is convenient to render a view on the server side.

We'll use the https://www.thymeleaf.org/[Thymeleaf^] Java template engine to render views.

=== Home

Create a controller to handle the requests to `/`. You will display the email of the authenticated person if any. Annotate the controller endpoint with `@View` since we will use a Thymeleaf template.

source:HomeController[]

callout:controller[number=1,arg0=/]
callout:secured-anonymous[number=2]
<3> Use https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/api/io/micronaut/views/View.html[View^] annotation to specify which template to use to render the response.
<4> The @api@/io/micronaut/http/annotation/Get.html[@Get^] annotation maps the `index` method to GET `/` requests.

Create a Thymeleaf template:

resource:views/home.html[]

Also, note that we return an empty model in the controller. However, we are accessing `security` in the Thymeleaf template.

- The https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/api/io/micronaut/views/model/security/SecurityViewModelProcessor.html[SecurityViewModelProcessor^]
injects into the model a `security` map with the authenticated user.  See
https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/guide/#security-model-enhancement[User in a view^] documentation.

=== OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant flow

Here is a high level diagram of how the authorization code grant flow works with an OAuth 2.0 provider such as LinkedIn.

=== OAuth 2.0 Configuration

Add the following OAuth2 Configuration:

resource:application.yml[tag=oauth2]

<1> Set `micronaut.security.authentication` to `cookie` to generate a signed JWT once the user is authenticated. The token is saved in a Cookie and read in subsequent requests.
<2> You can create a https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/api/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/signature/secret/SecretSignatureConfiguration.html[SecretSignatureConfiguration^] named `generator` via configuration as illustrated above. The `generator` signature is used to sign the issued JWT claims.
<3> Change this value to your own secret and keep it safe (do not store this in your VCS).
callout:oauth2-client-name[number=4,arg0=linkedin]
<5> Client Secret. See previous screenshot.
<6> Client ID. See previous screenshot.
<7> Specify the scopes you want to request. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/authentication?context=linkedin%2Fcontext#permission-types[Linked Permission Types^] let you specify exactly what type of access you need.
<8> Map manually the LinkedIn's https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.1[Authorization endpoint^].
<9> Map manually the LinkedIn's https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.2[Token endpoint^].
<10> Accept GET request to the `/logout` endpoint.

The previous configuration uses several placeholders. You will need to set up `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables.

[soruce, bash]
----
export OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=XXXXXXXXXX
export OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=YYYYYYYYYY
----

=== OAuth 2.0 Details Mapper

We need an HTTP Client to retrieve the user info. Create a POJO to represent a LinkedIn user:

source:LinkedInMe[]

Then, create a Micronaut Declarative HTTP Client to consume https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/integrations/people/profile-api[LinkedIn Profile endpoint^]

source:LinkedInApiClient[]

<1> Add the id `linkedin` to the `@Client` annotation. Later, you will provide URL for this client id.
<2> Define a HTTP GET request to `/v2/me` endpoint.
<3> You can return reactive types in a Micronaut declarative HTTP client.
<4> You can specify that a parameter binds to a HTTP Header such as the *Authorization* header.

Specify the URL for the `linkedin` service.

resource:application.yml[tag=micronaut-http-services]

Create an implementation of https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/api/io/micronaut/security/oauth2/endpoint/token/response/OauthAuthenticationMapper.html[OauthAuthenticationMapper]. The implementation must be qualified by a name that matches the name present in the client configuration. The value specified in the client configuration is `linkedin`.
