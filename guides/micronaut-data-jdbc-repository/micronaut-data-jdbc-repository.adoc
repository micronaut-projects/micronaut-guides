In this guide, we are going to write a Micronaut application that exposes some REST endpoints and store data in a
database using Micronaut Data JDBC.

include::{commondir}/common-requirements.adoc[]

include::{commondir}/common-completesolution.adoc[]

include::{commondir}/common-create-app.adoc[]


=== Data Source configuration

Add the following dependencies:

:dependencies:

dependency:micronaut-data-processor[groupId=io.micronaut.data,scope=annotationProcessor,callout=1]
dependency:micronaut-data-jdbc[groupId=io.micronaut.data,callout=2]
dependency:micronaut-jdbc-hikari[groupId=io.micronaut.sql,callout=3]
dependency:h2[groupId=com.h2database,scope=runtimeOnly,callout=4]

:dependencies:

<1> Add Micronaut Data annotation processor.
<2> Configures  a compile scoped dependency on the `micronaut-data-jdbc`
<3> Configures SQL DataSource instances using Hikari Connection Pool.
<4> Add dependency to in-memory H2 Database.

Define the data source in `src/main/resources/application.yml`.

resource:application.yml[tag=datasource]

NOTE: This way of defining the datasource properties means that we can externalize the configuration, for example for
production environment, and also provide a default value for development. If the environment variables are not defined
Micronaut will use the default values. +
Also keep in mind that it is necessary to escape the `:` in the connection url using back ticks ```.

=== DB Schema

We need a way to create the database schema. For that we will use
https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-flyway/latest/guide/index.html[Micronaut integration with
Flyway].


Add the following snippet to include the necessary dependencies:

dependency:micronaut-flyway[groupId=io.micronaut.flyway]

Configure the database migrations directory for Flyway in `application.yml`.

resource:application.yml[tag=flyway]

Create the file `V1__schema.sql` with the database schema creation:

resource:db/migration/V1__schema.sql[]

During application startup Flyway will execute the sql file and create the schema needed for the application.

=== Domain

To use JPA annotations include the following `compileOnly` scoped dependency:

dependency:jakarta.persistence-api[groupId=jakarta.persistence,version=@jakarta.persistence-apiVersion@,scope=compileOnly,callout=1]

Create the domain entities:

source:domain/Genre[]

The previous domain has a `OneToMany` relationship with the domain `Book`.

source:domain/Book[]


=== Application Configuration

Create an interface to encapsulate the application configuration settings:

source:ApplicationConfiguration[]

In Micronaut, you can create type safe configuration by creating classes that are annotated
with https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#configurationProperties[@ConfigurationProperties].

Create a `ApplicationConfigurationProperties` class:

source:ApplicationConfigurationProperties[]

<1> `@ConfigurationProperties` annotation takes a configuration prefix.

You can override `max` if you add to your `src/main/resources/application.yml`:

resource:application.yml[tag=application]


=== Repository Access

Next, create an interface to define the operations to access the database. The implementation of the following repository is created at compilation time by Micronaut Data.

source:GenreRepository[]

<1> `@JdbcRepository` with a specific dialect.
<2> `Genre`, the entity to treat as the root entity for the purposes of querying, is established either from the method signature or from the generic type parameter specified to the `GenericRepository` interface.


The repository extends from `PageableRepository`. It inherits the hierarchy `PageableRepository` -> `CrudRepository` -> `GenericRepository`.

|===
|Repository | Description

|`PageableRepository`
| A repository that supports pagination. It provides `findAll(Pageable)` and `findAll(Sort)`.

|`CrudRepository`
| A repository interface for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). It provides methods such as `findAll()`, `save(Genre)`, `deleteById(Long)` and `findById(Long)`.

|`GenericRepository`
| A root interface that features no methods but defines the entity type and ID type as generic arguments.

|===






=== Controller

include::{commondir}/common-validation.adoc[]

Create two classes to encapsulate Save and Update operations:

source:GenreSaveCommand[]

<1> Annotate the class with `@Introspected` to generate the Bean Metainformation at compile time.

source:GenreUpdateCommand[]

Create a POJO to encapsulate Sorting and Pagination:

source:SortingAndOrderArguments[]

<1> Use `javax.validation.constraints` Constraints to ensure the incoming data matches your expectations.

Create `GenreController`, a controller which exposes a resource with the common CRUD operations:

source:GenreController[]

<1> It is critical that any blocking I/O operations (such as fetching the data from the database) are offloaded to a separate thread pool that does not block the Event loop.
<2> The class is defined as a controller with the `@Controller` annotation mapped to the path `/genres`.
<3> Constructor injection.
<4> Maps a `GET` request to `/genres/{id}` which attempts to show a genre. This illustrates the use of a URL path variable.
<5> Returning `an empty optional when the genre doesn't exist makes Micronaut to response with 404 (not found).
<6> Maps a `PUT` request to `/genres` which attempts to update a genre.
<7> Add `@Valid` to any method parameter which requires validation. Use a POJO supplied as a JSON payload in the request to populate command.
<8> It is easy to add custom headers to the response.
<9> Maps a `GET` request to `/genres` which returns a list of genres. This mapping illustrates URL parameters being mapped to a single POJO.
<10> You can bind `Pageable` as a controller method argument. Check the examples in the following test section and read the https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-data/latest/guide/configurationreference.html#io.micronaut.data.runtime.config.DataConfiguration.PageableConfiguration[Pageable configuration] options.
<11> Maps a `POST` request to `/genres` which attempts to save a genre.
<12> Maps a `POST` request to `/ex` which generates an exception.
<13> Maps a `DELETE` request to `/genres/{id}` which attempts to remove a genre. This illustrates the use of a URL path variable.

=== Writing Tests

Create a test which verifies the CRUD operations:

test:GenreControllerTest[]

<1> Annotate the class with `@MicronautTest` to let Micronaut starts the embedded server and inject the beans. More info: https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-test/latest/guide/index.html[https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-test/latest/guide/index.html].
<2> Inject the `HttpClient` bean in the application context.
<3> Creating HTTP Requests is easy thanks to Micronaut's fluid API.
<4> If you care just about the object in the response use `retrieve`.
<5> Sometimes, receiving just the object is not enough and you need information about the response. In this case, instead of `retrieve` you should use the `exchange` method.

:exclude-for-languages:groovy

You can execute the `genres` endpoints exposed by the native image. For example:

[source, bash]
----
 curl localhost:8080//genres/list
----

== Using Postgresql

When running on production you want to use a real database instead of using H2. Let's explain how to use Postgres.

After installing Docker, execute the following command to run a postgresql container:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -it --rm \
    -p 5432:5432 \
    -e POSTGRES_USER=dbuser \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=theSecretPassword \
    -e POSTGRES_DB=micronaut \
    postgres:11.5-alpine
----

Add Postgresql driver dependency:

dependency:postgresql[groupId=org.postgresql,scope=runtimeOnly]

IMPORTANT: Change the dialect in the `GenreRepository` `@JdbcRepository` annotation.

To use postgresql, setup several environment variables which match those defined in `application.yml`:

[source,bash]
----
$ export JDBC_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/micronaut
$ export JDBC_USER=dbuser
$ export JDBC_PASSWORD=theSecretPassword
$ export JDBC_DRIVER=org.postgresql.Driver
----

Run the app again. If you take a close look to the output, you can see that the app uses postgresql:

[source, bash]
----
..
...
08:40:02.746 [main] INFO  org.hibernate.dialect.Dialect - HHH000400: Using dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQL10Dialect
....
----

Connect to your postgresql database, and you will see both `genre` and `book` tables.

image::datagrip.png[]

Save one genre, and your `genre` table will now contain an entry.

[source, bash]
----
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8080/genres" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{ "name": "music" }'
----
