Micronaut management dependency adds support for monitoring of your application via endpoints: special URIs that return details about the health and state of your application.

Add the `management` dependency:

dependency:micronaut-management[]

Once you include the `management` dependency a `/health` endpoint is exposed.

Create a test to verify it:

test:HealthTest[]

<1> Annotate the class with `@MicronautTest` to let Micronaut starts the embedded server and inject the beans. More info: https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-test/latest/guide/index.html[https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-test/latest/guide/index.html].
<2> Inject the `HttpClient` bean in the application context.
<3> Creating HTTP Requests is easy thanks to Micronaut's fluid API.

Before you create the environment click "Configure more options". If you forget, you could change this after you created the environment.

By default, Micronaut applications will listen on port 8080. Elastic Beanstalk assumes that the application will listen on port 5000. There are two ways to fix this discrepancy: change the port Elastic Beanstalk is configured to use, or change the port the Micronaut application listens on. For this post, we will change the port the Micronaut application listens on.

The easiest way to do this is to specify the **MICRONAUT_SERVER_PORT** environment variable in the Elastic Beanstalk environment and set the value to 5000. (The configuration property name is `micronaut.server.port`, but Micronaut allows you to specify a more environment variable-friendly name).

On the Configuration page in your environment, under Software Configuration, click the settings icon.

Now you are ready to click **Create Environment**.

After a few minutes you will be able to access the `/health` endpoint.
