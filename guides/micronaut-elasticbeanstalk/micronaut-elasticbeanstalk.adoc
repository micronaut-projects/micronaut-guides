Micronaut management dependency adds support for monitoring of your application via endpoints: special URIs that return details about the health and state of your application.

Add the `management` dependency:

dependency:micronaut-management[]

Once you include the `management` dependency a `/health` endpoint is exposed.

Create a test to verify it:

test:HealthTest[]

callout:micronaut-test[1]
callout:http-client[2]
callout:http-request[3]

Before you create the environment click "Configure more options". If you forget, you could change this after you created the environment.

By default, Micronaut applications listen on port 8080. Elastic Beanstalk assumes that the application listens on port 5000. There are two ways to fix this discrepancy: change the port Elastic Beanstalk is configured to use, or change the port the application listens on. For this post, we will change the application port.

The easiest way to do this is to specify the **MICRONAUT_SERVER_PORT** environment variable in the Elastic Beanstalk environment and set the value to 5000. (The configuration property name is `micronaut.server.port`, but the Micronaut framework lets you specify a more environment variable-friendly name).

On the Configuration page in your environment, under Software Configuration, click the settings icon.

Now you are ready to click **Create Environment**.

After a few minutes you will be able to access the `/health` endpoint.
