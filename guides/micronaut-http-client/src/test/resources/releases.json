GraalVM 22.1.0\r\n\r\nMicronaut framework 3.5 supports [GraalVM 22.1.0](https://www.graalvm.org/release-notes/22_1/).\r\n\r\n[Micronaut Gradle Plugin v3.4.0](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-gradle-plugin/latest/) and [Micronaut Maven Plugin v3.3.0](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-maven-plugin/releases/tag/v3.3.0) support GraalVM 22.1.0.\r\n\r\n### Incremental Compilation for Gradle Builds\r\n\r\nMicronaut framework 3.5 supports fully incremental compilation, including GraalVM metadata for Gradle Builds.\r\n\r\n### Micronaut Data\r\n\r\n[Micronaut Data 3.4.0](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-data/releases/tag/v3.4.0) supports:\r\n\r\n- Postgres enums for JDBC.\r\n- Pagination for reactive repositories and specifications.\r\n- Pagination for async, coroutines repositories, and specifications.\r\n\r\n### Turbo Integration\r\n\r\nMicronaut Views adds [integration with Turbo](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/guide/#turbo)\r\n\r\n### New Module - Micronaut Microstream\r\n\r\n[Micronaut Microstream](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-microstream/snapshot/guide/) eases working with [MicroStream](https://microstream.one), a native Java object graph storage engine.\r\n\r\n### @Scheduled with Time Zones\r\n\r\nOptionally, you can specify a time zone when using the <<scheduling,`@Scheduled` annotation>>.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Scheduled(cron = '1/33 0/1 * 1/1 * ?', zoneId = \"America/Chicago\")\r\nvoid runCron() {\r\n...\r\n..\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Support validation groups with `@Validated`\r\n\r\nYou can enforce a subset of constraints using [validation groups](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#validationGroups) using groups on the `@Validated`.\r\n\r\n### Advanced Listener Configuration\r\n\r\nMicronaut framework 3.5.0 offers more flexibility in configuring the HTTP Server. Instead of configuring a single port, you [can specify each listener manually](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#listener).\r\n\r\n### EPHEMERAL FACTORIES\r\n\r\nA [Factory](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#factories) has the default scope `@Singleton`, and it is destroyed with the context. Since Micronaut framework v3.5.0, you can dispose of the factory after producing a bean by annotating your factory class with `@Prototype` and `@Factory`\r\n\r\n### Module upgrades\r\n\r\n- [Micronaut Test 3.2.0](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-test/releases/tag/v3.2.0) adds support for KoTest 5.\r\n- [Micronaut AWS 3.5.0](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-aws/releases/tag/v3.5.0) adds a new module [Micronaut AWS CDK](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/guide/#cdk).
