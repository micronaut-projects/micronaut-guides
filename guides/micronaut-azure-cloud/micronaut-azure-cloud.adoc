== Writing the App

Create an application using the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#cli[Micronaut Command Line Interface] or with https://launch.micronaut.io[Micronaut Launch].

[source,bash]
----
mn @cli-command@ example.micronaut.micronautguide --build=@build@ --lang=@lang@
----

NOTE: If you don't specify the `--build` argument, Gradle is used as the build tool. +++<br/>+++ If you don't specify the `--lang` argument, Java is used as the language. Because Maven is the required build tool for this guide, it must be specified.

The previous command creates a Micronaut application with the default package `example.micronaut` in a directory named `micronautguide`.

common:annotationprocessors.adoc[]

To get started do the following:

- Install the https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest?WT.mc_id=opensource-micronaut-brborges[Azure CLI]

- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli?WT.mc_id=opensource-micronaut-brborges&view=azure-cli-latest#sign-in-interactively[Authenticate] with your Azure account

After you've checked out the links above, follow below for the next steps on setting up the Maven plugin for Azure deployment.

== Maven Plugin for Azure App Service

First, make sure you have the Azure CLI installed and authenticated:

[source,bash]
----
az login
----

Now you can run the following goal to install the Maven plugin and configure the required settings:

[source,bash]
----
mvn com.microsoft.azure:azure-webapp-maven-plugin:1.13.0:config
----

Make sure you select the following options:

 - OS: linux
 - pricingTier: F1 (Free_F1)
 - javaVersion: jre11

This is how it looks like:

----

== Sample Controller

Create a controller which we can invoke once the application is deployed.

source:HelloController[]

== Deploying the application

To deploy the application to Azure run:

[source,bash]
----
mvn package azure-webapp:deploy
----

With a `BUILD SUCCESS`, you should see a message containing the URL of your newly deployed web application:

----

== Logging

To see the log of your application running on Azure, you have to first enable storage of your application logging, and then perform a tail for live streaming.

To enable logging storage, use the following Azure CLI command. Check your `pom.xml` for the generated `<resourceGroup>` and the `<appName>`

`az webapp log config --name [appName] -g [resourceGroup] --web-server-logging filesystem`

Once this is done, you can then tail the log live from the cloud:

`az webapp log tail --name [appName] -g [resourceGroup]`

If you don't see any log, try changing the level of the project's Logback configuration in `logback.xml` to a higher value such as `debug`, then run the Maven deployment command again (you may need to run `mvn clean` prior to this step):

`mvn package azure-webapp:deploy`

Now, run the tail command above once again to view the logs.

== Cleaning Up

After you've finished this guide, you can clean up the resources you created on
Azure so you won't take the risk of being billed because of them in the future. The following
sections describe how to delete or turn off these resources.

Delete the resource group and all of its resources created along this guide with the following command:

`az group delete -g [resourceGroup]`

Answer `y` to confirm.

You can add the `--no-wait` parameter to not wait for the command to finish.
