The https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455[WebSocket Protocol] allows for web browsers to establish interactive sessions with a server that are event-driven. This technology is ideal for applications that need state changes without the overhead and latency of polling the server. The article https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/introduction-to-websockets/["Introduction to WebSockets"] explains the benefits of WebSocket in more depth, along with a discussion of the client-side WebSocket API.

This guide will take you through the creation of an event-driven chat application utilizing Micronaut WebSocket.

=== Front End

==== HTML

Add the HTML page to be the user interface for the chat client in the browser:
resource:public/index.html[]

==== Javascript

Write JavaScript to parse the URL for the chat topic and username, handle the message body, broadcast the chat, and keep the DOM updated with the latest messages:
resource:public/websocketDemo.js[]

==== CSS

Style the page so that the messages are properly displayed:
resource:public/style.css[]

=== Chat server

Our chat server is very simple. It merely allows you to connect and broadcast messages to subscribers of the topic. There's also a special topic called "all" that can make announcements and receive messages from all topics.

source:ChatServerWebSocket[]

callout:websocket-server[number=1]
callout:constructor-di[number=2,arg0=ChatServerWebSocket]
callout:websocket-on-open[number=3]
<4> Our chat server has a special topic called "all" that can make announcements and receive messages from all topics
callout:websocket-on-message[number=5]
callout:websocket-on-close[number=6]
<7> A predicate to keep messages within topics yet also enable the special "all" topic

=== Test

common:awaitility.adoc[]

The Micronaut frameworks eases the creation of Websocket servers and clients. 

Write a test that uses `ClientWebSocket` to test the application.

test:ChatServerWebSocketTest[]

callout:spec-name[1]
callout:micronaut-test[2]
callout:websocket-client[3]
callout:websocket-client-autocloseable[4]
callout:websocket-on-message[5]
<6> Any method name that starts with (or equals) "broadcast" or "send" will be used to broadcast messages, as long as the parameter is a String or a bean
callout:websocket-client-connect[7]
<8> Set up WebSocket clients for multiple users
callout:awaitility[7]
<10> Test that the correct messages are automatically sent when users join topics
<11> Test that chats are sent within a topic and not outside of it, with the exception of those sent using the special "all" topic
<12> Test that the correct messages are automatically sent when users leave topics

Open a browser and visit a URL such as http://localhost:8080/&num;/java/Joe[http://localhost:8080/\#/java/Joe]. Then in another browser tab, open http://localhost:8080/&num;/java/Moka[http://localhost:8080/\#/java/Moka]. You can then try sending chats as Joe and Moka.
