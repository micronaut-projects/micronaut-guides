The generated application contains a `BookController`. It responds to POST request to `/`.

source:BookController[]

* The class is defined as a controller with the `@Controller` annotation mapped to the path /
* The `@Post` annotation maps HTTP requests to `/` to the `save` method.
* Add the `@Valid` annotation to any method parameter's object which requires validation.

The controller's method parameter is a `Book` object:

source:Book[]

* Annotate the class with `@Introspected` to generate the Bean Metainformation at compile time.

It returns a `BookSaved` object:

source:BookSaved[]

* Annotate the class with `@Introspected` to generate the Bean Metainformation at compile time.

The generated tests illustrates how the code works when the lambda gets invoked:

test:BookControllerTest[]

* When you instantiate the Handler, the application context starts.
* Remember to close your application context when you end your test. You can use your handler to obtain it.
* You don't invoke the controller directly. Instead, your handler receives a AWS Proxy Request event which it is routed transparently to your controller.

== Lambda

Create a Lambda Function. As a runtime, select Java 11 (Correto).

=== Upload Code

include::{commondir}/common-executable-jar.adoc[]

Upload it:

image::upload-function-code.png[]

=== Handler

As Handler, set:

`io.micronaut.function.aws.proxy.MicronautLambdaHandler`

image::handler.png[]

=== Test

You can test it easily. As `Event Template` use `apigateway-aws-proxy` to get you started:
