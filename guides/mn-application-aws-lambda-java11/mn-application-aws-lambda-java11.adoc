The generated application contains a `HomeController`. It responds to POST requests to `/`.

source:HomeController[]

callout:controller[arg0=/]
* The `@Get` annotation maps HTTP requests to `/` to the `index` method.

The generated tests illustrates how the code works when the lambda gets invoked:

test:HomeControllerTest[]

* When you instantiate the Handler, the application context starts.
* Remember to close your application context when you end your test. You can use your handler to obtain it.
* You don't invoke the controller directly. Instead, your handler receives an AWS Proxy Request event which it is routed transparently to your controller.
