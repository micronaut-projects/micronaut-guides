== Getting Started

In this guide, we will integrate https://zipkin.io[Zipkin] with a Micronaut application composed of three microservices.

____
Zipkin is a distributed tracing system. It helps gather timing data needed to troubleshoot latency problems in microservice architectures. It manages both the collection and lookup of this data.
____

You will discover how the Micronaut framework eases Zipkin integration.

== Writing the Application

To learn more about this sample application, read the guideLink:micronaut-microservices-services-discover-consul[Consul and the Micronaut Framework - Microservices Service Discovery] guide. The application contains three microservices.

* `bookcatalogue` - This returns a list of books. It uses a domain consisting of a book name and an ISBN.

* `bookinventory` - This exposes an endpoint to check whether a book has sufficient stock to fulfil an order. It uses a domain consisting of a stock level and an ISBN.

* `bookrecommendation` - This consumes previous services and exposes an endpoint that recommends book names that are in stock.

The `bookrecommendation` service consumes endpoints exposed by the other services. The following image illustrates the application flow:

image::flow.svg[]

A request to `bookrecommendation` (http://localhost:8080/books) triggers several requests through our microservices mesh.

== Zipkin and the Micronaut Framework

=== Install Zipkin via Docker

The quickest way to start https://zipkin.io[Zipkin] is via Docker:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin
----


== OpenTelemetry dependencies

common:opentelemetry-annotations.adoc[]

common:opentelemetry-http.adoc[]

common:opentelemetry-exporter.adoc[]

Each service adds the OpenTelemetry Zipkin exporter dependency.

dependency:opentelemetry-exporter-zipkin[groupId=io.opentelemetry,scope=compile]

Each service sets `zipkin` as exporter in configuration:

common:yaml-dependency.adoc[]

resource:application.yml[app=bookcatalogue,tag=zipkin]

common:opentelemetry-disable.adoc[]

=== Changes to Book inventory

Annotate the `BookController` method with `@ContinueSpan` and the method parameter with `@SpanTag`:

source:BooksController[app=bookinventory]

callout:continue-span[1]
callout:span-tag[2]

== Running the Application

Run `bookcatalogue` microservice:

:exclude-for-build:maven

To run the application, execute `./gradlew run`.

:exclude-for-build:

:exclude-for-build:gradle

To run the application, execute `./mvnw mn:run`.

:exclude-for-build:

[source,bash]
----
...
14:28:34.034 [main] INFO  io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut - Startup completed in 499ms. Server Running: http://localhost:8081
----

Run `bookinventory` microservice:

:exclude-for-build:maven

To run the application, execute `./gradlew run`.

:exclude-for-build:

:exclude-for-build:gradle

To run the application, execute `./mvnw mn:run`.

:exclude-for-build:

[source,bash]
----
...
14:31:13.104 [main] INFO  io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut - Startup completed in 506ms. Server Running: http://localhost:8082
----

Run `bookrecommendation` microservice:

:exclude-for-build:maven

To run the application, execute `./gradlew run`.

:exclude-for-build:

:exclude-for-build:gradle

To run the application, execute `./mvnw mn:run`.

:exclude-for-build:

[source,bash]
----
...
14:31:57.389 [main] INFO  io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut - Startup completed in 523ms. Server Running: http://localhost:8080
----

You can run a cURL command to test the whole application:

[source, bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/books
----

[source,json]
----
[{"name":"Building Microservices"}]
----

You can then navigate to http://localhost:9411 to access the Zipkin UI.

The previous request generates a trace composed of 5 spans.

image::zipkinui-opentelemetry.png[]

In the previous image, you can see the requests to `bookinventory` are done in parallel.

In the previous image, you can see that:

- Whenever a Micronaut HTTP client executes a new network request, a span is involved.
- Whenever a Micronaut server receives a request, a span is involved.

The `stock.isbn` tags that we configured with `@SpanTag` are present, as shown in the next image:

image::zipkintag-opentelemetry.png[]

common:graal-with-plugins.adoc[]

:exclude-for-languages:groovy

Start the native images for the three microservices and run the same `curl` request as before to check that everything works with GraalVM.

:exclude-for-languages:

== Next Steps

As you have seen in this guide, without any annotations, you can get distributed tracing up and running quickly with the Micronaut framework.

The Micronaut framework includes several annotations to give you more flexibility. We introduced the `@ContinueSpan` and `@SpanTag` annotations.
Also, you have at your disposal the `@NewSpan` annotation, which will create a new span, wrapping the method call or reactive type.
