== Getting Started

Please read about https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/guide/#lambda[Micronaut AWS Lambda Support] to learn more about different Lambda runtime, Triggers, and Handlers, and how to integrate with a Micronaut application.

The biggest problem with Java applications and Lambda is how to mitigate Cold startups. Executing GraalVM Native executables of a Micronaut function in a Lambda Custom runtime is a solution to this problem.

In this guide, we will deploy a Micronaut Application as a GraalVM Native executable to an AWS Lambda custom runtime. If your Lambda integrates with https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/set-up-lambda-proxy-integrations.html[API Gateway via a Lambda Proxy], a Micronaut function of type `Application` with the `aws-lambda` feature is a good fit, especially when you have multiple endpoints which you wish to delegate to a single Lambda.

In this guide, we will create a Micronaut application written in @language@.

== Controller

The generated application contains a `HomeController`. It responds to POST request to `/`.

source:HomeController[]

callout:controller[arg0=/]
* The `@Get` annotation maps HTTP requests to `/` to the `index` method.

== Controller Test

The generated tests illustrates how the code works when the lambda gets invoked:

test:HomeControllerTest[]

* When you instantiate the Handler, the application context starts.
* Remember to close your application context when you end your test. You can use your handler to obtain it.
* You don't invoke the controller directly. Instead, your handler receives an AWS Proxy Request event which it is routed transparently to your controller.

== Lambda

Create a Lambda Function. As a runtime, select `Custom Runtime`

=== Upload Code

The Micronaut framework eases the deployment of your functions as a https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html[Custom AWS Lambda runtime].

The main API you will interact with is https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/api/io/micronaut/function/aws/runtime/AbstractMicronautLambdaRuntime.html[AbstractMicronautLambdaRuntime]. This is an abstract class which you can subclass to create your custom runtime `mainClass`. That class includes the code to perform the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html#runtimes-custom-build[Processing Tasks] described in the Custom Runtime documentation.

Once you have a ZIP file, upload it

=== Handler

As Handler, set:

`io.micronaut.function.aws.proxy.MicronautLambdaHandler`
