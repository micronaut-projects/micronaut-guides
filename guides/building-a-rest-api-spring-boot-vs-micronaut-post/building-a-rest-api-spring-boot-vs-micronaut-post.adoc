== Introduction

This guide compares how to write a POST endpoint backed by a persistence layer in a Micronaut Framework and Spring Boot applications.

The Spring Boot application uses https://spring.io/projects/spring-data[Spring Data] and https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html[H2]. The Micronaut application uses https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-data/snapshot/guide/[Micronaut Data] and H2.
Micronaut Data is a database access toolkit that uses Ahead of Time (AoT) compilation to pre-compute queries for repository interfaces that are then executed by a thin, lightweight runtime layer.

This guide is the fourth tutorial of https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/tag-building_a_rest_api.html[Building a Rest API] - a series of tutorials comparing how to develop a REST API with Micronaut Framework and Spring Boot.

== Controller

The controller receives a POST request with a JSON body, the repository persists the `SaasSubscription`, and then it returns
a 201 response with a `Location` HTTP Header.

As you will see, both controllers are almost identical, with similar annotations, as we discussed in the https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/guides/building-a-rest-api-spring-boot-vs-micronaut-implemeting-get.html[second guide] of this series.

The new APIs used in the following controllers are similar:

.Comparison between Spring Boot and Micronaut Framework
|===
| | Spring Boot | Micronaut


| Identify a method as a POST endpoint
| `@PostMapping`
| `@Post`

| Read and deserialize the request body to a method parameter
| `@RequestBody`
| `@Body`

| Fluid ApI to build a URI
| `UriComponentsBuilder`
| `UriBuilder`

=== Spring Boot Controller

source:SaasSubscriptionPostController[app=springboot]

callout:spring-boot-rest-controller[1]
callout:spring-boot-request-mapping[2]
callout:constructor-di[number=3,arg0=SaasSubscriptionRepository]
callout:spring-boot-post-mapping[number=4,arg0=createSaasSubscription,arg1=/subscriptions]
callout:spring-boot-request-body[5]


=== Micronaut Controller

source:SaasSubscriptionPostController[app=micronautframework]

callout:controller[number=1,arg0=/subscriptions]
callout:constructor-di[number=2,arg0=SaasSubscriptionRepository]
callout:post[number=3,arg0=createSaasSubscription,arg1=/subscriptions]
callout:body[4]
callout:uri-builder[5]

== Tests

common:assertj-and-json-path.adoc[]

The test saves a subscription and then uses the response `Location` header to fetch the saved subscription. It then compares if the GET response matches what we sent in the POST request.

=== Spring Boot Test

The following test shows that retrieving the status code or the location header from a `ResponseEntity` is easy.

test:SaasSubscriptionPostControllerTest[app=springboot]

callout:spring-boot-test[1]
callout:autowired[number=2,arg0=TestRestTemplate]
callout:spring-boot-test-rest-template[number=3]

=== Micronaut Test

The following test shows that retrieving the status code or the location header from a `HttpResponse` is easy.

test:SaasSubscriptionPostControllerTest[app=micronautframework]

callout:micronaut-test[1]
callout:http-client[2]

== Conclusion

As you see in this guide, the code to write a POST endpoint backed by a persistence layer in Micronaut Framework and Spring Boot applications is very similar. However, the Micronaut compile-time approach does not require reflection or proxies, leading to faster and more efficient applications.
