== What you will need

To complete this guide, you will need the following:

* Some time on your hands
* A decent text editor or IDE
* JDK 11 or greater installed with `JAVA_HOME` configured appropriately
* Docker installed
* A paid Oracle Cloud account (create an account at https://signup.oraclecloud.com[signup.oraclecloud.com])
* https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliinstall.htm[Oracle Cloud CLI] installed, with local access to Oracle Cloud configured by running `oci setup config`

== Writing the App

include::{commondir}/common-cli-or-launch.adoc[]

[source,bash]
----
mn create-function-app --features=oracle-function example.micronaut.micronautguide --build=@build@ --lang=@lang@
----

include::{commondir}/common-build-lang-arguments.adoc[]

If you use https://launch.micronaut.io[Micronaut Launch], select serverless function as application type and add the `oracle-function` feature.

include::{commondir}/common-default-package.adoc[]

include::{commondir}/common-annotationprocessors.adoc[]

The generated application contains a `Function` class with a simple Oracle Cloud API call to retrieve the tenancy OCID from the injected `TenancyIdProvider` bean. That will be sufficient to ensure that the deployed function works correctly:

source:Function[]

<1> This is needed because Project.fn invokes the function handler via reflection

include::{commondir}/common-testApp.adoc[]

== Configuring Oracle Cloud Resources

We need to configure some cloud infrastructure to support deploying functions.

First, login to your Oracle Cloud tenancy as an administrator, or a user with sufficient permissions to create the infrastructure described below.

=== Compartment

Use an existing compartment to create your function in, or create a new one by opening the Oracle Cloud Menu and clicking "Identity & Security", and then "Compartments"

=== Function user and group

Create a group for Oracle Functions users by clicking the Oracle Cloud menu and selecting "Identity & Security", and then click "Groups":

image::oraclefn/user1.png[]

Click "Create Group":

image::oraclefn/user2.png[]

Choose a name and a description, e.g. "mn-function-group", and click "Create":

image::oraclefn/user3.png[]

Create a user by clicking the Oracle Cloud menu and selecting "Identity & Security", and then click "Users":

image::oraclefn/user4.png[]

Click "Create User":

image::oraclefn/user5.png[]

Choose a name and a description, e.g. "mn-function-user", and click "Create":

image::oraclefn/user6.png[]

Scroll down and click "Add User to Group":

image::oraclefn/user7.png[]

Select the group you created and click "Add":

image::oraclefn/user8.png[]

You'll need an auth token to authenticate to the container registry that will contain the Docker images for your functions. Click "Auth Tokens" and then "Generate Token":

image::oraclefn/user9.png[]

Enter a name for the token, e.g. "mn-ocir", and click "Generate Token":

image::oraclefn/user10.png[]

Copy the token to the clipboard and save it for later:

image::oraclefn/user11.png[]

=== Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry (OCIR) repository

Your function will be deployed as a Docker image, so you need to choose a repo name in your tenancy. The repo will be created for you the first time you push an image to it.

The name can be simple, e.g. "mn-functions", or you can add a path prefix to help group the repos when there are many of them, e.g. "my-username/my-repo/mn-functions"

Update your build script with the location to deploy the docker container.

:exclude-for-build:maven

Edit `build.gradle` and replace `REGION`, `TENANCY`, and `REPO` with appropriate values:

[source, groovy]
----
dockerBuild {
    images = ["[REGION].ocir.io/[TENANCY]/[REPO]/$project.name:$project.version"]
}
----

For `REGION`, use the lowercase value from the "Region Key" column in https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm[Regions and Availability Domains], e.g. `iad`.

For `TENANCY`, use the Object Storage namespace string of the tenancy (as shown on the Tenancy Information page), e.g. `my-tenancy`.

For `REPO`, use the name of the repository to use, e.g. `mn-functions` (or `my-username/my-repo/mn-functions`).

The final value should look something like this:

[source, groovy]
----
dockerBuild {
    images = ["iad.ocir.io/my-tenancy/mn-functions/$project.name:$project.version"]
}
----

:exclude-for-build:

:exclude-for-build:gradle

Edit `pom.xml` and add these three properties in the `<properties>` section, replacing `REGION`, `TENANCY`, and `REPO` with appropriate values:

[source, xml]
----
<exec.mainClass>example.micronaut.Function</exec.mainClass>

<jib.docker.image>[REGION].ocir.io/[TENANCY]/[REPO]/${project.artifactId}</jib.docker.image>

<jib.docker.tag>${project.version}</jib.docker.tag>
----

For `REGION`, use the lowercase value from the "Region Key" column in https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm[Regions and Availability Domains], e.g. `iad`.

For `TENANCY`, use the Object Storage namespace string of the tenancy (as shown on the Tenancy Information page), e.g. `my-tenancy`.

For `REPO`, use the name of the repository to use, e.g. `mn-functions` (or `my-username/my-repo/mn-functions`).

The final properties should look something like this:

[source, xml]
----
<exec.mainClass>example.micronaut.Function</exec.mainClass>

<jib.docker.image>iad.ocir.io/my-tenancy/mn-functions/${project.artifactId}</jib.docker.image>

<jib.docker.tag>${project.version}</jib.docker.tag>
----

:exclude-for-build:

=== OCIR authentication

Login to OCIR by running:

[source, bash]
----
docker login <region-key>.ocir.io
----

Replace `<region-key>` with the value you used for `REGION` above, e.g. `iad.ocir.io`.

For the username, enter <tenancy-namespace>/<username>, e.g. `my-tenancy/mn-function-user`. If your tenancy is federated with Oracle Identity Cloud Service, use the format `<tenancy-namespace>/oracleidentitycloudservice/<username>`.

For the password, use the auth token you copied earlier.

=== Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) and Subnet

If you have a suitable VCN and subnet you can use those, or create new ones.

To create a VCN, open the Oracle Cloud Menu and click "Networking", then "Virtual Cloud Networks":

image::oraclefn/vcn1.png[]

Click "Start VCN Wizard":

image::oraclefn/vcn2.png[]

Select "VCN with Internet Connectivity" and click "Start VCN Wizard":

image::oraclefn/vcn3.png[]

Enter a name for the VCN, e.g. "mn-functions-vcn", and change the CIDR block values if needed:

image::oraclefn/vcn4.png[]

Review the settings and click "Create":

image::oraclefn/vcn5.png[]

=== Policies

We'll need to create some policies to grant various function-related permissions.

Open the Oracle Cloud Menu and click "Identity & Security", and then "Policies":

image::oraclefn/policy1.png[]

Select the root compartment from the drop-down and click "Create Policy":

image::oraclefn/policy2.png[]

Choose a name and description, e.g. "mn-functions-root-policy", and click "Show Manual Editor". Copy the following and paste it into the "Policy Builder" field, replacing "<group-name>" with the name of the group created earlier (e.g. "mn-function-group") and "<compartment-name>" with the name of the compartment you're using, and click "Create":

[source]
----
Allow group <group-name> to manage repos in tenancy
Allow group <group-name> to read objectstorage-namespaces in tenancy
Allow group <group-name> to manage logging-family in compartment <compartment-name>
----

image::oraclefn/policy3.png[]

Create another policy in the compartment where your function will be and choose a name and description, e.g. "mn-functions-compartment-policy". Copy the following and paste it into the "Policy Builder" field, again replacing "<group-name>" and "<compartment-name>", and click "Create":

[source]
----
Allow group <group-name> to manage functions-family in compartment <compartment-name>
Allow group <group-name> to read metrics in compartment <compartment-name>
Allow group <group-name> to use virtual-network-family in compartment <compartment-name>
Allow group <group-name> to use apm-domains in compartment <compartment-name>
Allow service faas to use apm-domains in compartment <compartment-name>
----

image::oraclefn/policy4.png[]

== Enable Tracing and Logs

Open the Oracle Cloud Menu and click "Observability & Management", and then "Administraction" under "Application Performance...":

image::oraclefn/logs1.png[]

Click "Create APM Domain":

image::oraclefn/logs2.png[]

Choose a name and description, e.g. "mn-function-apm", the compartment (and optionally check "Create as Always Free Domain"), then click "Create":

image::oraclefn/logs3.png[]

Navigate back to the function application page and click "Logs" (under "Resources") in the lower left:

image::oraclefn/logs4.png[]

Click the slider to enable logs, then choose the compartment to store them in, a log group, a log name, and the retention policy, and click "Enable Log":

image::oraclefn/logs5.png[]

Next, click "Traces" in the lower left:

image::oraclefn/logs6.png[]

Click "Configure", then choose the compartment, and the APM domain created earlier, and click "Enable Trace":

image::oraclefn/logs7.png[]

Finally, navigate to the application's function page and click the button to enable function tracing:

image::oraclefn/logs8.png[]

== Creating the function

First we'll need to build the function as a Docker image and push it to the OCIR repository.

Run:

:exclude-for-build:maven

[source, bash]
----
./gradlew dockerPush
----

:exclude-for-build:

:exclude-for-build:gradle

[source, bash]
----
./mvnw deploy -Dpackaging=docker
----

:exclude-for-build:

Once you've pushed the Docker container, create the function in the console. First, log out from your administrator account and log in as the user created above.

Open the Oracle Cloud Menu and click "Developer Services", and then "Applications" under "Functions":

image::oraclefn/function1.png[]

Click "Create Application":

image::oraclefn/function2.png[]

Choose a name for the application, e.g. "mn-guide-function-app", and select the VCN created earlier. Select the private subnet, and click "Create":

image::oraclefn/function3.png[]

Click the application link in the list, and then click "Create Function":

image::oraclefn/function4.png[]

Choose a name for the function, e.g. "mn-guide-function", select the repository where you pushed the Docker image, and select the uploaded image. Select 512MB memory and click "Create":

image::oraclefn/function5.png[]

Click the function link in the list, and click the "Copy" link in the OCID row; you'll need the OCID of the function to invoke the function:

image::oraclefn/function6.png[]

== Invoking the function

We'll use the OCI command line to invoke the function. Run the following, replacing `<OCID>` with the OCID of the function you copied above:

[source, bash]
----
oci fn function invoke --function-id <OCID> --file "-" --body ""
----

The output should look something like:

[source, bash]
----
Your tenancy is: ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaaaaaaud4g4e5ovjawn5cij7ke.................
----

The first invocation will take a while, probably 10-20 seconds or more (because a JVM needs to be started) but subsequent invocations should return in 1-2 seconds.
