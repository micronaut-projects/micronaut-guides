=== Tracer Configuration

If you used Micronaut CLI or Launch to create your application, the OpenTelemetry exporter will automatically be added to your `application.yml` configurations.

resource:application.yml[tag=otel-trace]

== Run the Application

The application can be deployed to Google Cloud Run, Cloud Function, Cloud Compute, or App Engine.

Traces can be sent to Google Cloud Trace outside the Google Cloud.

This allows us to run the application locally and see the traces in Google Cloud Trace.

== Traces

Open the https://console.cloud.google.com/traces[GCP Tracing Console].

{empty} +

If the data is not displayed, give it a minute. It takes a few seconds for the traces to show up in the console.

=== Get Item Counts

[source, bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/store/inventory/laptop
----
{empty} +

image::gcp-tracing/inventory-item.png[]

{empty} +

Each span is represented by a blue bar.

=== Order Item

[source, bash]
----
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8080/store/order" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{"item":"laptop", "count":5}'
----

{empty} +

Selecting a different span will show you the labels (a.k.a. attributes/tags) and other details of the span.

=== Get Inventory

[source, bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/store/inventory
----

{empty} +

Looking at the trace, we can conclude that retrieving the items sequentially might not be the best design choice.
