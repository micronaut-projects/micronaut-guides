== Getting Started

In this guide, you will create a Micronaut app which uses multiple authentication providers - an LDAP and a database authentication providers.

image:diagram-ldap-authentication.provider.svg[]

include::{commondir}/common-requirements.adoc[]

include::{commondir}/common-completesolution.adoc[]

include::{commondir}/common-create-app.adoc[]

Add `security-jwt` dependency:

:dependencies:

dependency:micronaut-security-annotations[groupId=io.micronaut.security,scope=annotationProcessor]
dependency:micronaut-security-jwt[groupId=io.micronaut.security]

:dependencies:

Modify `application.yml` to enable security:

resource:application.yml[tag=security]

<1> Set `micronaut.security.authentication` as `bearer`
<2> You can create a SecretSignatureConfiguration named `generator` via configuration as illustrated above. The generator signature is used to sign the issued JWT claims.
<3> Change this by your own secret and keep it safe (do not store this in your VCS)

=== Security LDAP

Micronaut supports authentication with LDAP out of the box. To get started, add the `security-ldap` dependency to your application.

dependency:micronaut-security-ldap[groupId=io.micronaut.security]

We are going to use an https://www.forumsys.com/tutorials/integration-how-to/ldap/online-ldap-test-server/[Online LDAP test server] for this guide.

Create several configuration properties matching those of the test LDAP Server.

resource:application.yml[tag=ldap]

<1> The LDAP authentication in Micronaut supports configuration of one or more LDAP servers to authenticate with. You need to name each one. In this tutorial, we use `default`.
<2> Each server has it's own settings and can be enabled or disabled.
<3> Sets the manager DN
<4> Sets the manager password.
<5> Sets the base DN to search.
<6> Enable group search.
<7> Sets the base DN to search from.

=== GORM

include::{commondir}/common-gorm.adoc[]

Add a GORM dependency to the project:

:dependencies:

dependency:micronaut-hibernate-validator[groupId=io.micronaut.beanvalidation]
dependency:micronaut-hibernate-gorm[groupId=io.micronaut.groovy]
dependency:h2[groupId=com.h2database,scope=runtimeOnly]
dependency:tomcat-jdbc[groupId=org.apache.tomcat,scope=runtimeOnly]

:dependencies:

And the database configuration:

resource:application.yml[tag=datasource]

==== Domain Classes

include::{commondir}/common-quotedomainclass.adoc[]

===== User

Create a interface `UserState` to model the user state.

source:UserState[]

Create `User` domain class to store users within our application.

source:domain/User[]

<1> GORM entities should be annotated with `grails.persistence.Entity`.
<2> Use of `GormEntity` to aid IDE support.

===== Role

Create `Role` domain class to store authorities within our application.

source:domain/Role[]

<1> GORM entities should be annotated with `grails.persistence.Entity`.
<2> Use of `GormEntity` to aid IDE support.

===== UserRole

Create a `UserRole` which stores a many-to-many relationship between `User` and `Role`.

source:domain/UserRole[]

<1> GORM entities should be annotated with `grails.persistence.Entity`.
<2> Use of `GormEntity` to aid IDE support.

==== Data Services

include::{commondir}/common-gormdataservices.adoc[]

Create various GORM Data services:

source:UserGormService[]

<1> Annotate with `@Service` to designate a http://gorm.grails.org/latest/hibernate/manual/index.html#dataServices[GORM Data Services] which is registered as a `Singleton`.

source:RoleGormService[]

<1> Annotate with `@Service` to designate a http://gorm.grails.org/latest/hibernate/manual/index.html#dataServices[GORM Data Services] which is registered as a `Singleton`.

source:UserRoleGormService[]

<1> Annotate with `@Service` to designate a http://gorm.grails.org/latest/hibernate/manual/index.html#dataServices[GORM Data Services] which is registered as a `Singleton`.
<2> GORM allows Statically-compiled JPA-QL Queries

=== Register Service

We are going to register a user when the app starts up.

source:Application[]

<1> Implements `ServerStartupEvent` which enables to execute a method when the application starts.
<2> `RegisterService` is injected via constructor injection.
<3> Register a new user when the app starts.

Create `RegisterService`

source:RegisterService[]

=== Delegating Authentication Provider

We are going to setup a http://docs.micronaut.io/snapshot/api/io/micronaut/security/authentication/AuthenticationProvider.html[AuthenticationProvider] a described in the next diagramm.

image::delegating_authentication_provider.svg[]

Next, we create interfaces and implementations for each of the pieces of the previous diagram.

==== User Fetcher

Create an interface to retrieve a `UserState` given a username.

source:UserFetcher[]

Provide an implementation:

source:UserFetcherService[]

<1> Use `javax.inject.Singleton` to designate a class a a singleton.
<2> `UserGormService` is injected via constructor injection.

==== Authorities Fetcher

Create an interface to retrieve roles given a username.

source:AuthoritiesFetcher[]

Provide an implementation:

source:AuthoritiesFetcherService[]

<1> Use `javax.inject.Singleton` to designate a class a a singleton.
<2> `UserRoleGormService` is injected via constructor injection.

==== Password Encoder

Create an interface to handle password encoding:

source:PasswordEncoder[]

To provide an implementation, first include a dependency to https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/3.1.x/reference/crypto.html[Spring Security Crypto] to ease password encoding.

Add the dependency:

dependency:spring-security-crypto[groupId=org.springframework.security,version=@spring-security-cryptoVersion@]

Then, write the implementation:

source:BCryptPasswordEncoderService[]

<1> Use `javax.inject.Singleton` to designate a class a a singleton.

==== Authentication Provider

Create an authentication provider which uses the interfaces you wrote in the previous sections.

source:DelegatingAuthenticationProvider[]

<1> The configured I/O executor service is injected
<2> RxJava's subscribeOn method is used to schedule the operation on the I/O thread pool

IMPORTANT: It is critical that any blocking I/O operations (such as fetching the user from the database in the previous code sample) are offloaded to a separate thread pool that does not block the Event loop.

=== LDAP Authentication Provider test

Create a test which verifies an LDAP user can login.

test:LoginLdapTest[]

<1> Annotate the class with `@MicronautTest` to let Micronaut starts the embedded server and inject the beans. More info: https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-test/latest/guide/index.html[https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-test/latest/guide/index.html].
<2> Inject the `HttpClient` bean in the application context.
<3> Inject to `TokenValidator` bean.
<4> Creating HTTP Requests is easy thanks to Micronaut's fluid API.
<5> If you attempt to access a secured endpoint without authentication, 401 is returned
<6> Use the `tokenValidator` bean previously injected.

=== Login Testing

Test `/login` endpoint. We verify both LDAP and DB authentication providers work.
