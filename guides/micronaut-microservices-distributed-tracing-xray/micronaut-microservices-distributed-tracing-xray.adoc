== Getting Started

In this guide, we are going to use https://opentelemetry.io[OpenTelemetry] to collect distributed
tracing information of a Micronaut application composed of three microservices and publish it to https://aws.amazon.com/xray/[AWS X-Ray]

____
AWS X-Ray helps developers analyze and debug distributed applications, such as those built using a microservices architecture. With X-Ray, you can understand how your application and its underlying services are performing to identify and troubleshoot the root cause of performance issues and errors. X-Ray provides an end-to-end view of requests as they travel through your application and displays a map of your application’s underlying components. You can use X-Ray to analyze both applications in development and in production, from simple three-tier applications to complex microservices applications consisting of thousands of services.

You will discover how the https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-tracing/latest/guide/[Micronaut framework eases AWS X-Ray integration via OpenTelemetry].

== Writing the application

The application contains three microservices.

* `bookcatalogue` - Returns a list of books. It uses a domain consisting of a book name and an ISBN.

* `bookinventory` - Exposes an endpoint to check whether a book has sufficient stock to fulfill an order. It uses a domain consisting of a stock level and an ISBN.

* `bookrecommendation` - Consumes previous services and exposes an endpoint recommending book names in stock.

The `bookrecommendation` service consumes endpoints exposed by the other services. The following image illustrates the application flow:

image::flow-dynamodb.svg[]

A request to `bookrecommendation` (`http://localhost:8080/books[http://localhost:8080/books^]`) triggers several requests through our microservices mesh.

https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/micronaut-intellij-idea-ide-setup.html[Setup IntelliJ IDEA to develop Micronaut Applications].

== Run AWS OTel Collector locally

See https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/blob/main/docs/developers/docker-demo.md[aws-otel-collector/blob/main/docs/developers/docker-demo.md]

* Clone https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector
* `vi examples/docker/config-test.yaml` and set the region
* `docker run --rm -p 4317:4317 -p 55680:55680 -p 8889:8888 -e AWS_REGION=us-east-1 -e AWS_PROFILE=default -v ~/.aws:/root/.aws -v "${PWD}/examples/docker/config-test.yaml":/otel-local-config.yaml --name awscollector public.ecr.aws/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector:latest --config otel-local-config.yaml`

== AWS Command Line Interface

Install the https://aws.amazon.com/cli/[AWS Command Line Interface] and run `aws configure`.
Set the same region you used in the previous section.

== OpenTelemetry dependencies

=== Micronaut OpenTelemetry HTTP

To enable creation of span objects on every HTTP server request, client request, server response, and client response,
each service includes the next dependency:

dependency:micronaut-tracing-opentelemetry-http[groupId=io.micronaut.tracing,scope=compile]

=== OpenTelemetry Protocol Exporter

An exporter is a component in the OpenTelemetry Collector configured to send data to different systems/back-ends.

Each service adds the OpenTelemetry Protocol exporter dependency.

dependency:opentelemetry-exporter-otlp[groupId=io.opentelemetry,scope=compile]

=== OpenTelemetry Propagator

To use AWS X-Ray propagator, each service adds the following dependency:

dependency:opentelemetry-extension-aws[groupId=io.opentelemetry,scope=compile]

and the following configuration:

common:yaml-dependency.adoc[]

resource:application.yml[app=bookrecommendation,tag=otel]

The previous configuration excludes health checks from being traced.

===  Using AWS resource detector

Each service includes the following dependency:

dependency:opentelemetry-aws-xray[groupId=io.opentelemetry.contrib,scope=compile]

These dependencies allow you to enable https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/java-sdk/trace-manual-instr#using-the-aws-resource-detectors[AWS resource detectors for enriching traces
 with AWS infrastructure information].

=== Instrumenting the AWS SDK

`inventory` and `catalogue` include the following dependencies to instrument the https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/java-sdk/trace-manual-instr#instrumenting-the-aws-sdk[AWS SDK]:

dependency:opentelemetry-aws-sdk-2.2[groupId=io.opentelemetry.instrumentation,scope=compile]

Both services use DynamoDB and include the following dependencies:

:dependencies:
dependency:micronaut-aws-sdk-v2[groupId=io.micronaut.aws,scope=compile]
dependency:dynamodb[groupId=software.amazon.awssdk]
:dependencies:

`micronaut-aws-sdk-v2` dependency creates a bean of type `SdkClientBuilder`. To instrument the AWS SDK,
Micronaut OpenTelemetry registers a tracing interceptor by creating a bean-creation listener for the bean of type `SdkClientBuilder`.

== Disable OpenTelemetry for tests

Each service disables OpenTelemetry for the tests classpath:

testResource:application-test.yml[app=bookrecommendation]

== Running the application

Run `bookcatalogue` microservice:

:exclude-for-build:maven

To run the application, execute `./gradlew run`.

:exclude-for-build:

:exclude-for-build:gradle

To run the application, execute `./mvnw mn:run`.

:exclude-for-build:

[source,bash]
----
...
14:28:34.034 [main] INFO  io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut - Startup completed in 499ms. Server Running: http://localhost:8081
----

Run `bookinventory` microservice:

:exclude-for-build:maven

To run the application, execute `./gradlew run`.

:exclude-for-build:

:exclude-for-build:gradle

To run the application, execute `./mvnw mn:run`.

:exclude-for-build:

[source,bash]
----
...
14:31:13.104 [main] INFO  io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut - Startup completed in 506ms. Server Running: http://localhost:8082
----

Run `bookrecommendation` microservice:

:exclude-for-build:maven

To run the application, execute `./gradlew run`.

:exclude-for-build:

:exclude-for-build:gradle

To run the application, execute `./mvnw mn:run`.

:exclude-for-build:

[source,bash]
----
...
14:31:57.389 [main] INFO  io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut - Startup completed in 523ms. Server Running: http://localhost:8080
----

You can run a cURL command to test the whole application:

[source, bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/books
[{"name":"Building Microservices"}
----

You can then navigate to AWS Console and access the X-Ray UI.

The previous request generates such a trace:

image::xraytrace-map.png[]
image::xraytrace.png[]

In the previous image, you can see that:

- Whenever a Micronaut HTTP client executes a new network request, it creates a new subsegment.
- Whenever a Micronaut server receives a request, it creates a new segment.

Moreover, you can see the requests to `bookinventory` are made in parallel.

== Next steps

As you have seen in this guide, you get distributed tracing up and running fast with the Micronaut framework without any annotations.

The Micronaut framework includes several annotations to give you more flexibility.

Make sure to read the documentation about https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/guide/index.html#xray[Micronaut X-Ray] integration.
